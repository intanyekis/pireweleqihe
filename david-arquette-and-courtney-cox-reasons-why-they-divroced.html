It’s difficult,” David replied when Andy asked if he felt “inferior” to Courteney during their marriage.</p><p>Describing himself as a “traditional male,” the actor said he felt pressured "provide and pick up the check and, you know, be the breadwinner."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In the acting world in general, you're always going on this rollercoaster of popularity and, you know, not able to get a job," he went on.

Rather, it was simply a matter of growing apart with time. "We probably don't get as real as we needed to as we do now,” Courteney previously said in an interview with Howard Stern.</p><p>“There are a lot of things that David likes to do completely the opposite things I do,” She went on. “I'm a homebody. David doesn't drink anymore, he's completely sober, but he likes to go out and dance."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She echoed a similar sentiment in a 2016 interview</a>, saying, "It wasn't a dramatic ending. We found ourselves living separate lives — just coexisting and being great friends, but not having the intimacy that is so important in a relationship.”</p><p>“We're just really different, too,” she continued. “I'm the polar opposite of him. And that can be great for a lot of things, but I need this kind of real, one-on-one connection."</p><p>Also, during her conversation with Howard Stern, Courteney revealed that their sexual needs and preferences also became an issue. “It was early in the morning," Courteney recalled of one instance. This is one of our problems in our relationship. Whenever I would need consoling from David, he could not literally put his arm around me for one second without completely getting a boner."</p><p>"[He] was never like, 'Oh, I'm so sorry your Dad is dying. Can we ****?'" she added.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If one thing is for sure, it’s that David and Courteney haven’t been shy to reveal the intricacies of their past relationship. Though Courteney’s success may have not been the deal breaker, it may have added pressure to an already-strained relationship.</p><p>Now, a decade since their divorce, David and Courteney may have moved on in other relationships, but the former couple swear they still care for each other deeply despite their differences. In the grand scheme of Hollywood divorces, that’s more than you can ask for.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6ZmXqivtCunK2slWKur7CMnKauqqSjsrp5wqivZqqVlsCwutJmrqGxXam1psWMnaCvqp%2BYsqV7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdavid-arquette-and-courtney-cox-reasons-why-they-divroced.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdavid-arquette-and-courtney-cox-reasons-why-they-divroced.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdavid-arquette-and-courtney-cox-reasons-why-they-divroced.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdavid-arquette-and-courtney-cox-reasons-why-they-divroced.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdavid-arquette-and-courtney-cox-reasons-why-they-divroced.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdavid-arquette-and-courtney-cox-reasons-why-they-divroced.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./shocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./shocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html>Goonew funeral: Shocking clip shows people partying next to dead rapper's 'standing' CORPSE</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brittney-palmer-bio-age-family-husband-net-worth.html>Brittney Palmer Bio Family Husband &amp;amp; Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brittney-palmer-bio-age-family-husband-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
