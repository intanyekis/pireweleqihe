It turns out that Kameron has a very high net worth of $4.5 million. Let's take a look at how she made her money.</p><h2 id=sparkle-dog-food>Sparkle Dog Food</h2><p>It's fair to say that most of the&nbsp;Real Housewives&nbsp;have a lot of money, like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carole Radziwill's $50 million net worth</a>. Kameron Westcott might not have quite that amount in the bank but her $4.5 million net worth is still amazing.</p><p>Fans of&nbsp;RHOD&nbsp;have seen Kameron talking about her dog food business and her desire to make pink food. She really does love pink and one glance at her Instagram page and she's often wearing this color. In the summer of 2020, Kameron shared a photo of her and her costars going camping and called herself "Camping Barbie."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the product's page on Amazon.com, it's made with chicken plus "a&nbsp;<span class=a-list-item>natural blend of vegetables, fruit, and protein." It has no preservations, gluten, or grains.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kameron-Westcott-With-Dog-Loius.jpg><p>In October 2017,&nbsp;People&nbsp;published a review of Kameron's dog food. The reviewer, Dave Quinn, mentioned that they weren't so sure about dog food that was pink: they wrote, "That being said, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t a little concerned about the idea of “pink” dog food when I first heard Westcott bring up the idea on RHOD. As a vegetarian and dog food-snob, I was nervous about putting something in my dog’s bowl that would be filled with chemicals and other junk." They shared that their dog, Peanut, seemed to enjoy the food and that it seemed to be a good product, as besides having red #3, there were healthy ingredients in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Romper&nbsp;reported that it doesn't appear like fans can buy this dog food anywhere but Amazon, where a bag that is eight ounces is priced at $28.88. Kameron has also created Sparkle Dog multivitamins and&nbsp;Romper&nbsp;notes that one flavor is called "fancy pancetta."&nbsp;Romper&nbsp;mentioned that some people posted on Amazon that their dogs were having "allergic reactions" and Kameron said that those were "fake reviews" and that people have been negative about her business.</p><p>Kameron shared, "Dogs seem to love it. So, I can just hold my head up high and be so excited, 'cause it's going well," according to&nbsp;Romper.</p><p>Sadly, Kameron's dog Louis passed away in 2019, and she had been with him since she was 21 years old. According to&nbsp;People, she shared,&nbsp;“He was my rock. Everything reminds me of him. I walk around the house, I have his bowls out. His closet, I have so many clothes for him. I turn on my iPhone, he’s there. It’s everywhere I turn and I just miss him so much.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘RHOC’: All About Gina Kirschenheiter’s Rocky Divorce</a></span></p><h2 id=her-marriage>Her Marriage</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Kameron-And-Court-Westcott.jpg><p>Kameron Westcott also has a high net worth because her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">husband's family has a very successful company</a>.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Slice.ca, Court is managing partner for Westcott LLC, which has been in his family for a long time. As the website mentions, the Westcott clan is among the Dallas families with the most money.</p><p>According to&nbsp;People, when Cary Deuber was talking about Kameron in an episode of&nbsp;The Real Housewives of Dallas, she talked about how much money Kameron has. She said, "Kameron Westcott is a Dallas socialite. It’s what Chris Rock always said: there’s rich people and then there’s the wealthy ones that write the rich people’s checks.

This does not pay our bills. No way. I think I’m very lucky about that. And, you know what, when my time is up my time is up.”</p><p>Kameron also said, “Some people feel like they have to bring contrived drama to stay on the show. I don’t really believe in that. The show would work if we just present our lives. It’s not about creating drama that isn’t there. It’s about opening up.” As it should be! The show’s title has the word 'real' in it for a reason."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‘RHOD’: What Is LeeAnne Locken’s Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dp7WwsIysq5qqXaCurrHRqKVmr5WowaS7061kmqWRqMCmsIyhnKtlZGKCbrnIpaOip55iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-rhod-star-kameron-westcott-amassed-her-4-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-rhod-star-kameron-westcott-amassed-her-4-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-rhod-star-kameron-westcott-amassed-her-4-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-rhod-star-kameron-westcott-amassed-her-4-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-rhod-star-kameron-westcott-amassed-her-4-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-rhod-star-kameron-westcott-amassed-her-4-5-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./oprah-sells-orcas-island-waterfront-estate.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./oprah-sells-orcas-island-waterfront-estate.html>Oprah Sells Orcas Island Waterfront Estate for $14 Million</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emma-roberts-gave-garrett-hedlund-ultimatums-before-split.html>Emma Roberts Gave Garrett Hedlund Ultimatums Before Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emma-roberts-gave-garrett-hedlund-ultimatums-before-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
