She has been present in a myriad of movies along the journey of her career, but her most memorable and outstanding role is her portrayal of Miranda Hobbes in the playfully seductive <a href=#>HBO Series </a>Sex and The City, which later was made into the highly anticipated Sex and the City movie in 2008 and Sex and the City 2 in 2010. For the many movies that Nixon has either starred or featured in, we'll take a look at some of the highest-grossing she's been a part of.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lymelife>Lymelife</h2><p>With an excellent array of actors, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rampart's</a> cast consisted of Woody Harrelson, Sigourney Weaver, Robin Wright, <a href=#>Ice Cube</a>, Steve Buscemi, and yours truly - Cynthia Nixon. Such a collaboration of actors would have one to believe that this movie would be golden. However, that expectation wasn't reflected in the gross box office earnings. On a budget of $12 million, the crime/drama film only generated $1.56 million. The movie follows a rough and tough cop named Officer Dave Brown (<a href=#>Woody Harrelson</a>) who has a tendency to set his own standard for justice and his violent tendencies tend to give him a bad rap. Nixon plays Barbara, one of the ex-wives of Officer Brown, who shares a home with him and his other ex-wife, Catherine. The film received mixed views from the extreme opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-only-boy-living-in-new-york>The Only Boy Living In New York</h2><p>True to her <a href=#>Manhatten</a> hometown, Cynthia Nixon stars in the 2017 drama film, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Only Living Boy In New York</a>. With another amazing line-up cast of characters, we see the collaboration of acting icons such as Pierce Brosnan, who plays Ethan Webb, the father of Thomas (Callum Turner), and husband to Judith Webb, played by Cynthia Nixon. The story is set in New York, as the title would suggest, and unfolds the story of a college graduate (Thomas) who rents his first apartment and end up befriending his alcoholic neighbor, played by Jeff Bridges. He soon learns his father is having an affair with a hot vixen named Johanna (<a href=#>Kate Beckinsale</a>) and pursues her to prevent his parents' marriage from failing. Although a refreshingly heartwarming film, it only grossed $2.1 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=five-flights-up>Five Flights Up</h2><p>Cast in another movie with elite actors like Morgan Freeman as Alex Carver and <a href=#>Diane Keaton </a>as Ruth Carver, Cynthia Nixon plays the role of the niece of the elderly married couple in this comedy-drama, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Five Flights Up</a>. Released in 2014, the film is centered around a five-story walk-up apartment that is owned by the Carvers, but due to their age, the climb is becoming too much to bear. Lilly (Christie Nixon), their niece, is their broker and, to alleviate their troubles, believes the home can be sold for $1 million. That and other nuances make it seem that selling the apartment is the best decision, but they later change their mind, which angers Lilly! The movie ended up grossing $2 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=the-manhattan-project>The Manhattan Project</h2><p>Taken from the name of the actual atomic bomb research and development project during <a href=#>World War 2</a> during 1942 and 1946, The Manhattan&nbsp;Project was released in 1986 as a sci-fi thriller, lending similar elements from the actual government undertaking. It focuses on a young man named Paul Stephens (Christopher Collet) who is the son of Elizabeth Stephens (Jill Eikenberry) who is dating a government scientist named Jonh Mathewson (<a href=#>John Lithgow</a>). Mr. Mathewson seems to be involved with explosive materials, which Paul gets a hold of. Paul's girlfriend, Jenny Anderman (Cynthia Nixon) is an aspiring journalist, and together they plan to expose the destructive atomic materials they find. But not to the liking of the Secret Service. The movie ultimately grossed $3.9 million on an $18 million budget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=igby-goes-down>Igby Goes Down</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Igby Goes Down </a>describes the life of a young suburban kid whose family is, for lack of a better term, dysfunctional. The film was released in 2002 and has a colorful cast of characters, with Kieran Culkin, the brother of <a href=#>Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin</a>, starring as Igby Slocumb. The other main characters in the movie are Jason Slocumb (Bill Pullman), Mimi Slocumb (Susan Sarandon), Oliver Slocumb (Ryan Phillippe), and Mrs. Piggee (Cynthia Nixon). After coming to the realization of his disturbed family, he seeks to find a better life for himself. On a budget of $9 million, the movie turned over $6.9 million at the global box office.</p><h2></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marvin-s-room>Marvin's Room</h2><p>When it comes to one of the best line-ups in film history, Marvin's Room is one up there with the best. The movie features a young<a href=#> Leonardo DiCaprio</a> as the son of Lee, played by Meryl Streep. Her sister, Bessie, is played by Diane Keaton and has been caring for their ill father, Hume Cronyn.<a href=#> Robert De Niro</a> also stars in the movie as Dr. Wally, who informs Bessie that she has leukemia. Cynthia Nixon doesn't have a major role in this movie but has the brief part of a retirement home director. Despite her role not being major, the movie still managed to gross $12.8 million at the box office.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adam-s-family-values>Adam's Family Values</h2><p>If you're looking for dark comedy, then look no further than the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Addams Family Values</a> film, released first in 1993, and then the Addams Family Reunion in 1998. Nixon again had a short stint in the film as a potential nurse being hired to look after the children of Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) and Morticia Addams (<a href=#>Anjelica Huston</a>), Wednesday Addams (Christina Ricci), and Pugsley Addams (Jimmy Workman). As macabre and cruel as some of the jokes were in the movie, that didn't stop it from being a box office hit, grossing a frightening $48.9 million, while the Addams Family Reunion motion picture in 2019 generated over $200 million.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amadeus>Amadeus</h2><p>Being one of the older films she has been featured in, Cynthia Nixon was just 17 when she played the role of Lori in the historical drama category of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amadeus.</a> The movie was released in 1984 and focuses on a young and <a href=#>talented composer</a> from Vienna named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), known today as Mozart for his brilliant contribution to music, who unknowingly ends up a rival with another dedicated composer named Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) due to his adept composing skills. Out of fierce jealousy, Salieri sets out to destroy Mozart, who is unaware of his ill feelings. The movie did exceptionally well for its era, grossing $90 million at the box office.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Every Cast Of The Sex And The City's Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sex-and-the-city-2>Sex And The City 2</h2><p>Out of the numerous films Cynthia Nixon has graced with her presence, the one she is most praised and remembered for is her role in <a href=#>Sex and the City and Sex and Sex and the City 2.</a> Sex and the City first began as an HBO Series drama series in 1998 which lasted for six seasons, culminating in 2004. The movie franchise uses the same cast of characters from the series, which consists of <a href=#>Sarah Jessica Parker</a> (Carrie Bradshaw), Kim Cattrall (Samantha Jones), Kristin Davis (Charlotte York), and, yours truly, Cynthia Nixon (Miranda Hobbs). Both the film and the series explore modern dating, friendships, and sex life, of course. The film grossed $294.6 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>&nbsp;</p><h2 id=sex-and-the-city>Sex And The City</h2><p>The Sex and the City girls were back at it again in 2010 with <a href=#>Sex and the City 2</a>. As was the theme of the previous movie, they were going about their lives, hooking up and breaking up along the way, while maintaining their close friendship. This time, they plan a girls' trip to Abu Dhabi to escape from their hectic lives as older women. However, while on the trip, Samantha (<a href=#>Kim Cattrall</a>) meets her ex who is filming a movie in the same location. There are also cameo appearances featuring Liza Minnelli, Miley Cyrus, and Penelope Cruz to name a few. The first franchise actually did a lot better than the second, grossing $418.8 million at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Best Reaction To SATC&nbsp; Star Cynthia Nixon's Governor Announcement</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">RogerEbert.com,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IndieWire</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mental Floss</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMpqannalitaLA05qlZqiipLemr9Nmn6KfmJrAtXnGq6asq5mjtG6v2KeroaGRYruqxM6nZKanpp6ytHs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-money-hattan-project-highest-grossing-cynthia-nixon-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-money-hattan-project-highest-grossing-cynthia-nixon-movies.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-money-hattan-project-highest-grossing-cynthia-nixon-movies.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-money-hattan-project-highest-grossing-cynthia-nixon-movies.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-money-hattan-project-highest-grossing-cynthia-nixon-movies.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-money-hattan-project-highest-grossing-cynthia-nixon-movies.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bishop-eddie-longs-death-reactions-480329.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bishop-eddie-longs-death-reactions-480329.html>Black Twitter Reacts To Bishop Eddie Longs Death</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tamara-taylor-net-worth.html>Tamara Taylor Net Worth How Much is Taylor Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tamara-taylor-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
