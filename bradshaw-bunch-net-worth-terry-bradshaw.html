Unlike other reality shows based on the life of stars, you'd be surprised at the amount of shenanigans Terry and his family get up to as they navigate their extraordinary lives. While most people know Terry Bradshaw does pretty well for himself financially, what of the other members of his household?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is What Fans Really Think About 'The Bradshaw Bunch'</a></span></p><h2 id=terry-bradshaw---45-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Terry Bradshaw - $45 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Terry Bradshaw started his football career early in his life, but he wasn't drafted until 1970. Within the same decade of being drafted, he managed to win four Superbowl titles while he played with Pittsburgh. Apart from being the first quarterback in his time to win three and four Super Bowls, he also led the Steelers to eight AFC Central championships. Terry achieved all of this while still playing, but when he did stop playing, he simply transitioned into the entertainment world like several other NFL player have done after him.</p><p>Terry Bradshaw's time in front of the camera started as a television sports analyst, later he became the co-host of Fox NFL Sunday. After seeing his talents, he was then <a href=#>featured in several movies</a> including the hit, Failure To Launch. While the superstar earns a lot from having his own reality show, he also has several other sources of income, including royalties and paid adverts. All of this has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">helped him amass a lifetime fortune presently estimated to be worth $45 million.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tammy-bradshaw---15-million><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tammy Bradshaw - $15 million</span></h2><p>After over a decade and a half together, Tammy finally became the big "Mrs" in Terry Bradshaw’s life. The pair officially tied the knot in July 2014, and since then, it's been a joy for the pair. In the earlier years of her life, Tammy Bradshaw was a successful model and built a career for herself in that line.</p><p>While she still earns royalties from her days as a model, Tammy is regarded as a social media personality and earns a lot more money from adverts and endorsements due to her large social media following. Currently, the reality sta<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">r has been estimated to have a net worth of $15 million</a>. Tammy has also been part of several philanthropic works and looks forward to being part of several others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Has The Hamill Family From 'Our Little Family' Been Up To In 2021?</a></span></p><h2 id=rachel-bradshaw---5-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Rachel Bradshaw - $5 million</span></h2><p>Rachel Bradshaw is the oldest daughter of the Bradshaw household and is from Terry’s previous marriage to Charlotte Hopkins. While her father is regarded as an NFL legend, Rachel decided to forge her own path in life. After finishing at Belmont University, she took to the entertainment world, and now, it's safe to say that her dad might not be the only legend from the family, as she is on her way to becoming one too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rachel is a successful singer, songwriter, and all-around entertainment personality with multiple awards to her name. She got signed straight out of college as a solo country artist, and based on her public finances, the industry has been pretty smooth for the star financially as<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> she has stacked up a net worth of $5 million</a>.</p><h2 id=lacey-hester---5-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Lacey Hester - $5 million</span></h2><p>Lacey Hester is Terry and Tammy’s daughter, even though she was biologically born of Tammy’s previous relationship with David Luttrull. Lacey is also in the entertainment line, much like her step-sister, Rachel, but in Lacey’s case, she's an actress, making her the perfect fit for the Bradshaw reality show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lacey’s life hasn't always been easy, as she lost her brother over a decade ago to a drug overdose, and while he lives on in her heart, she has managed to get past it with the help of her family. A few years after the loss, the 37-year-old chose to tie the knot with her soul mate, Noah Hester. Much like the other in the house, Lacey has also been doing really well for herself financially and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">is now worth $5 million.</a></p><h2 id=erin-bradshaw---3-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Erin Bradshaw - $3 million</span></h2><p>Erin Bradshaw is more proof of the love for sports running in the blood of the Bradshaw family. However, she didn't go down the football path, instead, she became successful as an equestrian and even landed the title as the world champion. Just like Rachel, Erin was also born from Terry Bradshaw’s marriage to Charlotte Hopkins. Shortly after she began her career in the equestrian line, the star got married to Scott Weiss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While they were married, it took them a little time to have a child but in late 2021, the pair announced that they were expecting their first child together. It came as a surprise to the entire Bradshaw family and Terry couldn't have been happier for his daughter and the fact that he was going to be a grandfather. One of the things that have kept the love burning between Erin and her husband is their mutual love for horses. To that effect, they established a company that, at its start, was into producing 10 to 15 foals annually. For Erin, the company and some other outside <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earnings have shot her net with up to $3 million.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How 'My Big Fat Fabulous Life' Star, Whitney Thore's Life And Net Worth Changed After The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=noah-hester---1-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Noah Hester - $1 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're a big Bradshaw Bunch follower, then you've probably heard the name ‘Noah Hester’ a few times. He is married to Terry’s daughter, Lacey, and is also a professional chef. Growing up, he spent most of his time on the Kohala Coast, and that led him to pick a liking to the flavors of the Pacific Rim. In fact, it was one of the factors that made him pursue a career in the culinary arts.
