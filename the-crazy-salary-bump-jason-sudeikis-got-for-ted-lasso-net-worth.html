As it turns out, Apple TV is paying a premium to get the star on the show back for the upcoming season. We'll take a look at how his pay scale shifted dramatically following the first two seasons.</p><p>In addition, we'll discuss some extra bonuses he has in his contract behind the scenes. Let's just say he's making '<strong><a href=#>Friends</a></strong>' kind of money, matched with a lot of creative control.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is all well-deserved and as we'll reveal, he put a lot of thought and work into the character. Let's take a look at how it all came about and the type of revenue and control he has for the third season.</p><h2 id=sudeikis-put-a-lot-of-work-in-perfecting-the-role>Sudeikis Put A Lot Of Work In Perfecting The Role</h2><p>Sudeikis will be the first to admit, he's normally playing a different kind of role, one that is a bit of an a-hole, at least when looking at the trajectory of his career in films. This one is completely different in many ways, the exact opposite. In playing the role, not only is Jason tapping into his creative side but <a href=#>he's also using different forms of motivation</a>, such as a book on Psychedelics, as he revealed alongside Datebook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It is a good vibe to swim around in. Ted is egoless. He has that ability to see people as they truly are and allow them to be themselves and reflect back to them that they are absolutely enough just the way they are. (Pollan’s) “How to Change Your Mind” came out right as we were writing the pilot, and it helped make this invisible thing in my head visible, to be able to explain it to the writing staff."</p><p>"I remember early on in the writing stage, I’d be like, “Hey, this show is rooted in the tenets of divine feminism,” and that need not be in the female form. That exists in the male form and in every gray area in between."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Fans React To Jason Sudeikis Finally Addressing His Breakup With Olivia Wilde</a></span></p><p>He is all about playing the role of a nice guy, which is such a change as opposed to the anti-hero we've seen in the past. For Jason, there is an important story to be told with his character, "A big theme of the show is not about the elimination of toxic masculinity or bullies or evil, it’s about how we deal with those things."</p><p>We're glad that with all this thought and hard work, has come huge success. Not only is the show a massive hit with the masses but as it turns out, Jason is going to get rewarded in a huge way for season 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-salary-skyrocketed-for-season-3>His Salary Skyrocketed For Season 3</h2><p>According to Business Insider, <a href=#>Jason's pay is taking a huge leap forward for season 3</a>. During season 1, he was making a generous salary of $250,000. The second season saw yet another upgrade of $300,000. Given the buzz surrounding the show and the fact that the season two premiere was the largest audience of an Apple TV+ show, it only makes sense that the star of the show saw another huge bump for season three. During the new season, he'll make 'Friends' kind of money, at $1 million per episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Everything To Know About 'Lady In The Lake' On Apple TV</a></span></p><p>There aren't many people that way claim that this kind of salary is not merited, especially given the salaries for TV shows in the current days.</p><p>In addition to the pay raise, he'll also see a unique shift to his creative control on the show.</p><h2 id=he-also-has-knew-creative-control-clauses>He Also Has Knew Creative Control Clauses</h2><p>Not only is the actor getting a steady bump but the same goes for those around him, such as the writing team. In addition, his new deal includes compensation as a writer and producer, which will only increase his overall fee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The raise is well-deserved, as the show enjoyed massive numbers for the month of July. The program has an excellent binge-watch rate, said to be higher than juggernauts like 'The Office' and 'Friends', at a 61.3% capacity.</p><p>Huge numbers for the show and we can only expect them to increase given all the success and buzz.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Tom Hanks' World War 2 Movie Greyhound Is Heading To Apple TV+</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dmL%2BixthmqpqkkafGbq7UpqdmopGovK950q6bnqGbnsBus86tZJ%2BnomLBprCMpZisq59iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-crazy-salary-bump-jason-sudeikis-got-for-ted-lasso-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-crazy-salary-bump-jason-sudeikis-got-for-ted-lasso-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-crazy-salary-bump-jason-sudeikis-got-for-ted-lasso-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-crazy-salary-bump-jason-sudeikis-got-for-ted-lasso-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-crazy-salary-bump-jason-sudeikis-got-for-ted-lasso-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-crazy-salary-bump-jason-sudeikis-got-for-ted-lasso-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tyler-james-williams-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tyler-james-williams-biography.html>Tyler James Williams Bio (Wiki)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jordan-bratman.html>Music Maven's Journey Through Love, Business, and Co-Parenting with Christina Aguilera Revealed</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jordan-bratman.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
