Here's everything you need to know about the young boy they welcomed a little over a year after their first son Isaiah.</p><p class=dh>Christina Milian and Matt Pokora welcomed their son Kenna Tota in 2021. The little boy is Milian's second son with Pokora, with whom she also shares her son Isaiah. She is also a mom to 12-year-old Violet Madison Nash.</p><p class=dh>While the young boy is growing up fast and is over a year old, little is known about him. Let's take a closer look at his life through what his parents have shared about him so far.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/5d26d0ded1081b5c86da481cb93abfb4.jpeg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Matt Pokora and Christina Milian attend a basketball game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Phoenix Suns at Staples Center on January 01, 2020 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>FACTS ABOUT KENNA TOTA</strong></p><p class=dh>Before Kenna Tota's arrival, Milian and Pokora were happy to announce their pregnancy just four months before her due date. Through a gorgeous sunset photo at the beach, the singer revealed she was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/christina-milian-pregnant-expecting-third-child/>expecting her third child</a> by showing off her baby bump.</p><p class=dh>In the snap shared by Milian, Pokora kneels to kiss her belly while they enjoyed the beautiful sunset by the beach. A second pregnancy announcement photo was shared by Pokora, showing their young infant son Isaiah placing his tiny hand on his mom's baby bump.</p><p class=dh>Just four months after the announcement, Kenna Tota was born on April 24, 2021. The little boy was born a Taurus, making him a tolerant, warmhearted, and reliable friend and family member like others who fall under the star sign.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after Kenna's birth, the proud mom shared a lengthy message about her pregnancy and birth on Instagram, along with a photo of her on the hospital bed. Her sweet statement <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COEG5zrn4VE/>read:</a></p><p class=dh>"Wow, What an adventure we’ve been on since the day he was conceived! I thank God everyday for blessing me with his super active energy (wonder where he gets it from?) and now to meet our healthy baby boy?! Thankful. Blessed."</p><p class=dh>When Kenna turned one, Milian made sure to shower him with love on social media by sharing a series of pictures and videos of her young son's smile. Although she cropped his eyes in the montage, fans were able to see the little boy's endearing smile and adorable double chin.</p><p class=dh>The proud mom calls her second son "my little clown," sharing that he's shown her there are "100s of ways to smile" with his facial expressions. "I'm so happy to be your Mom, my little clown. You have me wrapped around your finger forever," she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CcwXvqTppV2/>gushed</a>.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE PARENTS OF KENNA TOTA</strong></p><p class=dh>Although Kenna is only starting to understand the world around him, he will soon realize that he comes from a family of stars. Like his siblings, he will have to navigate life under the spotlight and maybe someday even follow in his famous parents' footsteps.</p><p class=dh>His dad, Matthieu Tota, best-known as Matt Pokora, is a French singer, actor, and producer. He is known for his <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1994189/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">work</a> on "Robin des Bois, la veritable histoire," "Asterix and the Vikings," and "M. Pokora: Alexandrie, Alexandra."</p><p class=dh>Meanwhile, his mom Christina Milian, born Christine Flores, is an American singer, with her hit song "Dip It Low" once <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0587396/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm">topping the charts.</a> She also ventures into acting with movies like "Falling Inn Love," "Bring It On: Fight to the Finish," and the upcoming "Resort to Love."</p><p class=dh>Milian and Pokora have been together since 2017 after <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/12/11/who-is-matt-pokora/>meeting</a> at a restaurant in France. The restaurant's manager insisted the pair meet, as they were both musicians. The two of them hit it off and have stayed strong ever since.</p><p class=dh>In 2020, a French publication <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.public.fr/News/Exclu-Public-surprise-M-Pokora-s-est-marie-avec-Christina-Milian-tous-les-details-1661639>announced</a> that Milian and Pokora secretly tied the knot amidst them welcoming their first son Isaiah. It was a clandestine event attended by only their closest family and friends.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>THE SIBLINGS OF KENNA TOTA</strong></p><p class=dh>A year and three months before Kenna was born, his mom gave birth to his older brother, Isaiah, on January 20, 2020. Just a month before Isaiah turned one, Milian and Pokora announced they were expecting Kenna, which means Milian was taking care of her infant son while pregnant with another little one.</p><p class=dh>Before Isaiah and Kenna, Milian was already a proud mom to an adorable young girl named Violet Madison Nash. She gave birth to her on February 26, 2010, and shares her with her ex-husband, The-Dream.</p><p class=dh>Milian would gush about her eldest daughter, commending her for being the most thoughtful and caring big sister. The proud mom shared an adorable snap of Violet and Kenna gazing at each other, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/COUTm51H1Qz/>sharing:</a></p><p class=dh>"I feel like Kenna recognizes his big sister from all the time she spent talking to him in my belly. He’s literally so calm and just stares at her."</p><p class=dh>Milian and The-Dream began <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/15738998/christina-milian-kids-how-many/>dating</a> in February 2009 before getting hitched in a Las Vegas chapel just a little bit after six months. Unfortunately, they separated three months later, before the birth of their daughter.</p><p class=dh>It took Milian several tries at love before finally finding her happily-ever-after with Pokora. She dated rapper Lil Wayne and comedian Nick Cannon before meeting her now-husband.</p><p class=dh>Now, Millian couldn't be happier with how her life turned out. She is a doting mom to three beautiful children and a proud wife to a hardworking and talented man.</p><p class=dh>Every chance she gets, she makes sure to gush about her beautiful family on social media, showing fans that no matter how busy her career gets, she will always prioritize her family and put them first.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwa2llbHqssc2nmGasn6mubrXSZphmq5%2BjeqS00aKqraGelnqutcuimKdllpawb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f292157-kenna-tota-is-a-son-christina-milian-fac-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f292157-kenna-tota-is-a-son-christina-milian-fac-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f292157-kenna-tota-is-a-son-christina-milian-fac-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f292157-kenna-tota-is-a-son-christina-milian-fac-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f292157-kenna-tota-is-a-son-christina-milian-fac-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f292157-kenna-tota-is-a-son-christina-milian-fac-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./meet-edson-jeune-benita-alexanders-ex-husband-620389-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./meet-edson-jeune-benita-alexanders-ex-husband-620389-html.html>Meet Edson Jeune Benita Alexanders Ex-Husband</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./jules-bianchi.html>Jules Bianchi</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./jules-bianchi.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
