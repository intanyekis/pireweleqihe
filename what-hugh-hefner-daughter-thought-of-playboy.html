But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crystal, his last wife, was also troubled afterward</a>.</p><p>It was rough on everyone, but Hugh's kids have been surprisingly normal since. But their childhoods weren't quite like the average family's. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditors</a> found out that Hugh's daughter Christie had a particular view of the organization her father ran, and the Playboy Mansion, in particular.</p><p>An old article in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Magazine</a> -- circa 1982 -- highlighted parts of Christie's childhood that were really surprising to fans (and critics). As Redditors summed up, Christie used to visit the Playboy Mansion as a child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans will recall that Christie is now an adult (she was born in 1952), so it was early days at Playboy when she was hanging around the Mansion as a teen. But she didn't really understand exactly what was happening inside Playboy's doors at the time.</p><p>Redditors recapped that when Christie would visi, the "mansion was cleaned up" and the "kinky" stuff was put away.</p><p>Hiding things from Christie didn't last that long, though. After she became an adult, Christie actually became the president of Playboy. But when she was a teen, her dad was involved with Barbi Benton, who Christie said seemed like a perfectly nice girlfriend to her father.</p><p>She said that when she visited the Mansion, the highlight was pinball machines that you didn't have to put quarters in. The teen thought it was awesome, and although her mom had once said that Christie was "jealous" of all the women giving her dad attention, Christie herself told&nbsp;New York Magazine that she thought the Mansion was "wonderful."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's nice to know that even through all the years of the media dragging Hugh Hefner, Christie felt like her dad's house was great and that it was "nice to see someone enjoying the fruits of their labors."</p><p>Not to mention, it was nice having a career to slide into once Christie finished up her illustrious education in Massachusetts!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Who Inherited Most Of Hugh Hefner's Estate And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrW2s8dmn56enpq%2FbrDArp6hrJWnerW0zq6eoaxdpLNuvMuasJunqWQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-hugh-hefner-daughter-thought-of-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-hugh-hefner-daughter-thought-of-playboy.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-hugh-hefner-daughter-thought-of-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-hugh-hefner-daughter-thought-of-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-hugh-hefner-daughter-thought-of-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-hugh-hefner-daughter-thought-of-playboy.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-identify-a-raw-diamond.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-identify-a-raw-diamond.html>How To Identify A Raw Diamond</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emotional-support-barbies-can-improve-adults-mental-health-psychologist.html>Emotional support Barbies can improve adults mental health: psychologist</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emotional-support-barbies-can-improve-adults-mental-health-psychologist.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
