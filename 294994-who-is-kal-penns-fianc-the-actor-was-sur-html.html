Despite having a famous beau, Kal Penn's partner prefers to live away from the spotlight.</p><p class=dh>Kal Penn has become a household name in the world of comedy. He began his acting career in various indie films before landing his breakthrough role in "Harold & Kumar," which propelled him to Hollywood stardom.</p><p class=dh>Penn's career soared to greater heights, and he even published a memoir detailing the ups and downs of his life and romantic partnerships. Within the pages of his book, he disclosed that he is currently engaged to Josh.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Who Is Kal Penn's Fiancé Josh?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>There is not much information available about Josh, but Penn's memoir, "You Can't Be Serious," claims they have been together for a long time.

They lounged around the television to watch the NASCAR race; after that, Josh would go home.</p><p class=dh>Penn was sure their relationship would not work at that time if Josh continued to pay more attention to the NASCAR race than their blossoming romance. Despite his initial disinterest, Penn eventually enjoyed Josh's favorite show.

While the political activist did not go into detail about his and Josh's engagement, the comedian did announce their unforgettable milestone while revealing his real sexuality.</p><p class=dh>Josh is rarely seen publicly, and his job or identity remains unclear. After Penn announced their engagement, some media outlets reportedly noted that the man wearing a cap who sat beside the comedian at a basketball game in New York City in March 2018 was his fiancé.</p><p class=dh>The rumored sighting of Josh at the basketball game was not the only time he made an appearance in public. He also appeared in a few of Penn's Instagram photos from the previous New York City Pride Parade events.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>When Did Kal Penn Discover His Sexuality?</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Even though Penn came to terms with his sexuality much later in life than most people, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/books/kal-penn-engagement-to-fiance-josh-first-date-new-book-you-cant-be-serious/>emphasized</a> that "there's no timeline" for individuals who consider themselves part of the LGBTQIA+ community to reveal who they are.</p><p class=dh>Penn expresses his gratitude toward his loved ones for their continuous encouragement and support throughout his life, his successful career, and, more specifically, his relationship with Josh.</p><p class=dh>Penn's beloved family, who are of Indian descent, and his close friends were the first to become aware of his real sexuality and relationship with his fiancé.</p><p class=dh>According to Penn, his parents accepted his identity wholeheartedly, just as they did when he told them he wanted to be an actor. He remembered how easy it was to discuss his ambition with them.</p><p class=dh>The former "House" actor also stated that everyone has different experiences revealing themselves to their families. For his part, Penn considers himself fortunate to have been raised in a loving and supportive family.</p><p class=dh>In his recently published memoir, Penn had no idea that writing about his excellent relationship with Josh would surprise many people. In a SiriusXM interview, he <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://youtu.be/aKd4RUux0Is>stated</a> that his book meant a lot to many people "in the most loving way."</p><p class=dh>Penn only devoted one chapter to his and Josh's romance; however, if he had been aware that readers were interested in learning more about their relationship, he would have been happy to add three more chapters.</p><p class=dh>When asked how Josh, who values privacy more than anything else, handled the sudden interest in their relationship, Penn quipped that being the center of attention was still "not a favorite thing" for his fiancé.</p><p class=dh>Penn's unexpected coming out story is one of the most intriguing news today. Similarly, "Pitch Perfect" star <a class="me a" href=#>Rebel Wilson</a> recently surprised fans by saying she is in a same-sex relationship with fashion designer Ramona Agruma after dating a slew of men in Hollywood.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwbXFpaXq4tM5moKxlm5a5brzEp6WsZZaerq%2BvjK2fnmWRmMGwvoywmKxlo6q%2Fb7TTpqM%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f294994-who-is-kal-penns-fianc-the-actor-was-sur-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f294994-who-is-kal-penns-fianc-the-actor-was-sur-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f294994-who-is-kal-penns-fianc-the-actor-was-sur-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f294994-who-is-kal-penns-fianc-the-actor-was-sur-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f294994-who-is-kal-penns-fianc-the-actor-was-sur-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f294994-who-is-kal-penns-fianc-the-actor-was-sur-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./zooyouporn-com.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./zooyouporn-com.html>47 Top Zooyouporn.com Alternatives</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-are-louis-oosthuizen-parents-everything-about-them.html>Who Are Louis Oosthuizen Parents?
