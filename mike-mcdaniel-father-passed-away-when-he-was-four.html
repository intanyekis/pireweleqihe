On his Twitter or Instagram pages, he never gave his siblings any credit.</p><p>The fans of McDaniel will only become further estranged as a result of this error. The story was incorrectly classified as white by the sports website Deadspin when it was published.&nbsp;</p><p>A great example of media bias is this.
