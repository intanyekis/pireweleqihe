An addictive combination of romance, drama, reality, and tension, viewers just love to watch the events of these international couple's journeys towards (or maybe away from) marriage. The 90-day timer that starts once the fiance enters the United States on their K1 visa (or enters their fiance's country in the case of spinoff '<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Other Way</a>') certainly adds an element of urgency and excitement, and can either bring the couples closer together or bring out their worst. Let's take a look at 10 of the couples we love, or love to hate, and see if the love has lasted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rebecca-and-zied>Rebecca and Zied</h2><h2></h2><p>This couple instantly became fan favorites from the moment that Zied Hakimi arrived at the airport in his native Tunisia to meet his fiance Rebecca Parrott, who lives in Georgia, wearing a t-shirt with her face on it! During the couple's time in Tunisia on 90 Day Fiance, they had their ups and downs. They clashed over Rebecca's tattoos, her heavily filtered online photos, and they even clashed over clothing. After all was said and done, Zied took Rebecca on a romantic trip into the desert where he ended up proposing, much to Rebecca's delight. Of course, she accepted, and as of very recently the couple is still very much together and planning a wedding.</p><h2 id=russ-and-paola>Russ and Paola</h2><h2></h2><p>Cultures definitely clashed when Russ met his love Paola from Bucaramanga, Colombia. The pair met when Russ was visiting Bucaramanga for work and love quickly blossomed. Conservative Russ had some opinions about Paola's more relaxed Latin attitude towards showing some skin, particularly when it came to her modeling work, and Paola wasn't thrilled with the idea of living in Ohio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Classiest Couples From 90 Day Fiance (And 5 Most Ratchet)</a></span></p><p>It was touch and go at times, particularly when Pao's 'best friend' Juan (who was not&nbsp;a fan of Russ!) got involved. The pair managed to work it out though and got married. The pair are still together and welcomed their baby boy Axel earlier this year.</p><h2 id=colt-and-larissa>Colt and Larissa</h2><p>Colt and Larissa's relationship on the show was certainly a cautionary tale. While many 90 Day couples have managed to prove that long-distance love can work and that your soulmate might just be on the other side of the world, Colt and Larissa do not fall into that category. Larissa De Santos Lima, from Brazil, seemed less than amused when Colt Johnson moved her into the Las Vegas house that he shares with his mother Debbie and an unspecified number of cats. Whilst the duo provided some solid entertainment as Larissa clashed with Debbie and nagged 'Colty' to buy her various things, the relationship turned toxic and the pair divorced after Larissa was arrested several times on domestic abuse charges.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-and-annie>David and Annie</h2><p>The moment when David Toborowsky paraded along the paths of fiance Annie Suwan's village in Thailand dressed to the nines in traditional robes was certainly unforgettable! Between David's interesting financial and employment situation and Annie's straight-talking attitude we have certainly seen some memorable moments! When the pair moved to the states they were living in all manner of unusual accommodation like a firehouse and an office space in a storage unit complex, while David got himself a job. The couple have stuck together through it all and are happily married living in a house where they have a <a href=#>strong social media game</a> and continue to provide entertainment on the spin-off show 90 Day Fiance: Pillow Talk.</p><h2 id=paul-and-karine>Paul and Karine</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p>These two crazy kids are possibly the most on-again-off-again of the whole bunch! Paul Staehle met his now-wife Karine online. Paul traveled to Brazil to live with Karine while she was pregnant with his child. Paul provided us with some absolute gems of scenes, including one where he took time out to put a sort of homemade 'sheath' on before swimming to protect his manhood from any water-dwelling nasties, and another in which he had a full of tantrum and retired to a strange cage-like structure in Karine's garden for a self-imposed time out. The pair are married and now have a son, Pierre, together. They have been on the brink of divorce before, but it looks like the honeymoon might be over as the couple is talking divorce once more.</p><h2 id=darcy-and-jesse>Darcy and Jesse</h2><h2></h2><p>Darcey Silva first appeared on our screens as part of 90 Day Fiance when we followed her journey with then-fiance Jesse Meester. Darcey met Jesse, who is from the Netherlands, through a dating app. The pair were certainly entertaining to watch as Jesse made comment after comment about Darcey's drinking, and Darcey accused him of being controlling. The couple have, unsurprisingly, gone their separate ways but they continue to bring the drama.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Facts You Never Knew About Darcey Silva</a></p><p>Darcey recently returned to our screens for another shot at international romance with foreign suitor Tom, from England. When Darcey and Tom turned up at the reunion show, guess who also made an appearance. Yes, of course, Jesse was there. These two are the gift that keeps on giving!</p><h2 id=nicole-and-azan>Nicole and Azan</h2><p>Nicole and Azan are a mystery to most viewers. The pair met online and Nicole traveled to Morocco, Azan's native country, with her daughter May so that they could spend time together as a family, plan a wedding, and get married. To date, the couple are still not married, but are still together in a sort of long-distance limbo where they seem to be constantly planning a wedding that never comes. At times the relationship has seemed a bit (cat)fishy with plans to meet in other countries going awry and money going missing, but if they are happy then who are we to judge!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jorge-and-anfisa>Jorge and Anfisa</h2><h2></h2><p>If bad relationships had their own page in the dictionary, you might just find a picture of Jorge Nava and Anfisa Arkhipchenko next to it. During their time on the show, the pair fought about basically everything; money and honesty were top of the list though. Viewers felt that Anfisa was very focused on money, which was fairly understandable, and Jorge has exaggerated his wealth before Anfisa arrived in the United States. Jorge was no angel and lied to Anfisa about everything and nothing. Basically, if he opened his mouth he was telling fibs.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebs You Didn't Know Started Out On Reality TV Show Competitions</a></span></p><p>Jorge's decisions in life took a turn for the worse, as he was arrested with a large amount of marijuana in his car. Jorge was eventually given a custodial sentence of 2.5 years, and it is uncertain whether or not the couple will remain together when Jorge is released next year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=molly-and-luis>Molly and Luis</h2><p>When Molly first brought Luis to live with her, you could be forgiven for thinking he was just another resident teenager. This is not because of the couple's age difference (although at 15 years it is not to be ignored) as Louis was moody, had inappropriate conversations with Molly's teenage daughter and showed off his default 'we are having an argument' maneuver of going to his room, shutting himself in, and playing loud music. It came as no shock when the couple parted ways and divorced.</p><h2 id=chantel-and-pedro>Chantel and Pedro</h2><p>Chantel and Pedro are the gold standard of 90 Day Fiance couples. Chantel brought her fiance Pedro to the states from the Dominican Republic on a fiance visa, but the couple didn't get off to the best of starts as Chantel told her family that Pedro was in the states on a student visa. Honesty is the best policy, and Chantel would come to regret this move which started a long term mistrust of Pedro and his intentions which only worsened when the whole family took a trip to the D.R. to meet Pedro's family. The drama was so intense that the couple had their own spin-off show The Family Chantel&nbsp;also on TLC.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Reality Show Stars Of 2019</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWhxYGKxosWMn6CappOaerG7z66jmqpdmLy2vMueqmabpae%2FprrTZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90-day-fiance-popular-couples-current-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90-day-fiance-popular-couples-current-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90-day-fiance-popular-couples-current-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90-day-fiance-popular-couples-current-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90-day-fiance-popular-couples-current-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90-day-fiance-popular-couples-current-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./charles-krauthammer-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./charles-krauthammer-net-worth.html>Charles Krauthammer Net Worth How Much is Charles Krauthammer Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./21-things-only-mike-fisher-could-tell-us-about-carrie-underwood.html>21 Things Only Mike Fisher Could Tell Us About Carrie Underwood</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./21-things-only-mike-fisher-could-tell-us-about-carrie-underwood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
