Under her stage name Diamond, she is a rapper, best known to be a former member of the group Crime Mob. She’s also embarked on a solo career, releasing various albums, mix tapes, as well as collaborating with numerous artists. All of her endeavors have helped put her net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Diamond? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $100,000, mostly earned through her career in the music industry. She’s been nominated a few times for her music and has released eight mixtapes. Diamond has also made guest appearances, and is featured in other artists’ music. As she continues her career it is expected that her wealth will increase.</p><h3>Diamond Net Worth $100,000</h3><p>Diamond started her career in music at a very young age, becoming part of Crime Mob at the age of fifteen. They released the single “Knuck if You Buck” which became very popular, eventually certified Platinum, and earning the group national recognition, after which the group would release their first, self-titled album. This continued with a few more song releases, and then they worked on their second album – “Hated on Mostly” – releasing it during 2007.</p><p>In late 2007, Diamond decided to pursue a solo career and left Crime Mob. One of her first appearances as a solo artist was on a remix of Ludacris’ “My Chick Bad”, which featured her along with Eve and Trina.

In 2011 she released “Buy It All”, and it earned her a nomination for Best Female Hip Hop Artist during the 2011 BET Awards. The following year, she released another single “Loose Screws” and got herself another nomination at the BET Awards. Her album, “The Young Life”, was released in August 2012, which had songs including “Love Like Mine” and “American Woman”. One of her recent projects is the reality television show “Sisterhood of Hip-Hop” which is produced by Oxygen; the show features artists such as Bia, Nyemiah Supreme, and Brianna Perry.</p><p>Aside from her music career, Diamond is very popular on social media, boasting over 500,000 followers on Instagram. She also has over 200,000 followers on Twitter. Her accounts often display upcoming projects and shows.</p><p>For her personal life, it is known that she was previously in a relationship with<a href=#> Soulja Boy</a>, and is currently in a relationship with Payro.
