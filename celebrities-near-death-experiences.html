And going through so much in such a small amount of time and so quickly, for me, it put my life into perspective. There were certain things I focused on â€” I focused on how grateful I was for the things I had versus the things I lost. I got a second chance at life and I want to use it. I didn't want to waste it by dwelling on what happened or why it happened."</p><h2 id=gerard-butler><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Gerard Butler</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Gerard Butler is another celebrity who had his own brush with death.
