We’re talking about a man who’s been living it up, thanks to <a href=#>his billion-dollar fortune</a>. In fact, he’s got <a href=#>a sick collection of cars</a>. Not to mention, he owns <a href=#>a private jet he’s nicknamed Air Mayweather</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Look At Floyd Mayweather's $275 Million Payday</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, all this fortune (and fame) doesn’t always translate to a peaceful family life. In recent years, one of his daughters, Iyanna, has gotten into some serious trouble. And since then, it seems Mayweather had decided not to give his daughter any attention on social media.</p><h2 id=who-is-iyanna-mayweather-and-how-close-is-she-to-her-famous-dad>Who Is Iyanna Mayweather And How Close Is She To Her Famous Dad?</h2><p>Iyanna, who also goes by the nickname Yaya, is Mayweather’s daughter with ex-girlfriend Melissa Brim. As far as fans know, Mayweather had always enjoyed spoiling Iyanna. In fact, for her 14th birthday, the boxing legend reportedly paid Nicki Minaj $50,000 to show up to Iyanna’s party. Meanwhile, Mayweather also spared no expense during Iyanna’s sweet 16. The event reportedly cost seven figures and it featured performances from Future and Drake. Not only that, Mayweather also gifted his daughter a Mercedes G-Wagon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Fans Confused After It Emerges He's 'Engaged To Girlfriend'</a></span></p><p>As Iyanna got older, she had tried to make a name for herself in the entertainment world by releasing music using the alias Money Yaya. She has also become a social media celebrity. Meanwhile, as far as relationships go, Iyanna has famously been involved with rapper NBA YoungBoy. The pair welcomed a son, Kentrell Jr., earlier this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back when Iyanna was still an expecting mother, Mayweather candidly spoke about his daughter’s pregnancy, telling Hollywood Unlocked, “If that makes her happy, then we’re happy…me and her mother are happy.” The boxing star further explained, “What I try not to do is be in her personal business because once she’s no longer under my roof, then you know what? it’s between her and her better half.” Meanwhile, Mayweather also spoke about NBA YoungBoy saying, “As far as NBA… I look at NBA YoungBoy as a child. I can’t get upset with a kid like that. It could’ve been one of those days for him.”</p><h2 id=iyanna-was-arrested-in-2020>Iyanna Was Arrested In 2020</h2><p>In more recent years, Iyanna attracted controversy after she was arrested for allegedly assaulting a woman named Lapattra Lashai Jacobs in 2020. According to a statement from Harris County’s Constable Mark Herman, Iyanna had been involved in a verbal altercation with Jacobs and somehow this “escalated to her stabbing the victim multiple times in the bicep.” Herman further confirmed, “Iyanna Mayweather was arrested and booked into the Harris County Jail, charged with Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Her bond was set at $30,000.00 out of the 248th District Court.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reports indicate that Jacobs was NBA Youngboy’s fiancé. Moreover, the incident had occurred in his home. According to TMZ, Iyanna had reportedly told cops that Jacobs had started the fight by pulling her hair. Following her arrest, Iyanna was later released on bail.</p><h2 id=has-floyd-mayweather-been-ignoring-iyanna-since-her-arrest>Has Floyd Mayweather Been Ignoring Iyanna Since Her Arrest?</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some may be under the impression that Mayweather has been ignoring Iyanna since he hasn’t really acknowledged her on his social media recently. Interestingly enough, however, his other children have been appearing on his feeds. In fact, he’s even posted videos of boxing training sessions he’s held with son Koraun Mayweather. Moreover, fans may have also thought that Mayweather was alluding to Iyanna’s recent troubles when he posted a video with Koraun with the caption, “Never claimed to be perfect, but I strive to be the best father possible.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Is The Latest Celeb To Deactivate Instagram Comments</a></span></p><p>Mayweather may not be posting about Iyanna on social media but that doesn’t necessarily mean that he’s ignoring his daughter. After all, this billionaire has been supportive of her from the beginning. Not to mention, he’s one person who values his children more than anything else. Not to mention, Mayweather’s been a doting grandpa to Iyanna’s newborn, Kentrell Jr. Earlier this year, the boxing legend even took his grandson for a ride on his private jet. Aside from that, Mayweather also gifted Kentrell Jr. a diamond-encrusted Rolex Oyster Perpetual Datejust watch. Iyanna once posted a photo of Kentrell Jr. and his new watch with the caption, “KJ's papa got him his first Rolex.” She also tagged her dad in the post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, Mayweather and his daughter are in touch. And if they want some privacy at the moment, the fans will just have to respect their wishes and wait. After all, Mayweather also once said that he talked to Iyanna about keeping family matters private. “What I’ve always taught my daughter is this: always be respectful when you’re going to anyone’s home,” the boxer said in his interview. “And whatever goes on in your home, don’t talk about it to the world.” Just the same, fans are definitely hoping Kentrell Jr. would appear on his grandpa’s social media feeds someday soon.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Floyd Mayweather Accused Of 'Ruining Legacy' After Fight Date With Logan Paul</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidpaepmXqurdiwnJqsmJq%2FbrDArp6hrJWneqK%2B0Z6qrZ2UYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXs%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffloyd-mayweather-daughter-arrested-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffloyd-mayweather-daughter-arrested-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-daughter-arrested-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffloyd-mayweather-daughter-arrested-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-daughter-arrested-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffloyd-mayweather-daughter-arrested-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./eamonn-walker-becomes-latest-cast-member-to-leave-chicago-fire.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./eamonn-walker-becomes-latest-cast-member-to-leave-chicago-fire.html>Eamonn Walker Becomes Latest Cast Member to Leave Chicago Fire</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./corey-graves.html>Corey Graves</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./corey-graves.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
