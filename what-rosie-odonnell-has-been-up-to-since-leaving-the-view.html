In addition, she has had quite a few of her personal troubles hit the spotlight as well, though this hasn't put her career at a halt. Below is a list of what Rosie O'Donnell has been up to since her days on The View came to an end.</p><h2 id=she-opened-up-about-her-mental-health><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>She Opened Up About Her Mental Health</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">November 2017 interview with Howard Stern</a>, O'Donnell revealed she had been on Effixer since 2003 to cope with depression. In addition, she also told Stern she was sexually abused as a child and used to have suicidal thoughts. Months later in an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with health advocate Mike Henick</a> on his So-Called Normal podcast, she once again spoke about her depression battle, stating her insecurities with weight and seeing photos of herself were some of the reasons for her diificult emotions.</p><p>"You have to be willing to participate in your mental health, and if you aren’t willing to participate in it, there is destruction all around, mainly to yourself," O'Donnell said to Henick.</p><h2 id=her-beef-with-donald-trump-never-ended><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Her Beef With Donald Trump Never Ended</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During her first run on The View in late 2006, O'Donnell expressed distate towards Donald Trump and the controversy of his Miss USA pageant, believing the winner Tara Conner should deserve a second chance after her crown was taken due to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">drug and underage drinking scandal</a>. Shortly afterwards, Trump called her names in various interviews and threatened to sue her. During Trump's 2016 presidential run, O'Donnell continued to speak out against him. Through social media, she has frequently made her anti-Trump stance clear.</p><p>"I spent like, pretty much 90 percent of my waking hours tweeting hatred towards this administration," she said referring to the Trump administration in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2017 interview on Late Night with Seth Meyers</a>.</p><h2 id=a-previously-strained-relationship-with-her-daughter><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>A Previously Strained Relationship With Her Daughter</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, O'Donnell's troubles with her oldest daughter Chelsea O'Donnell came to light after her daughter was <a href=#>reported missing</a>. Though she was found one week after the missing report (having run away), Chelsea later publicly spoke out about her argumentative texts with her mother and their complicated relationship, claiming she was kicked out (which Rosie denied). The two eventually reconciled, with Chelsea later <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">giving birth to Rosie's first grandchild</a> in December 2018, which Rosie often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posts about on social media</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Moment Fans Started Turning On Rosie O'Donnell</a></span></p><h2 id=a-divorce-and-an-engagement-that-ended><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>A Divorce And An Engagement That Ended</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Earlier in 2015, O'Donnell filed for divorce from Michelle Rounds, whom she married in July 2012. The couple engaged in a custody battle over their adopted daughter Dakota, which the former View host was ultimately awarded. Two years after the divorce, Rounds <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">committed suicide</a> after a struggle with depression. In late 2018, O'Donnell became engaged to police officer and Army veteran Elizabeth Rooney until their split the following year. Back in July, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News reported she was seeing someone</a>, though O'Donnell has not revealed any details.</p><h2 id=frequent-tiktok-activity><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Frequent TikTok Activity</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Last year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">O'Donnell joined TikTok</a>, often posting videos of her daily life (including some with family members) and stitching with other people's videos almost on a weekly basis. Furthermore, she also uses the app simply to interact with fans, including one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who thanked her for encouraging her to come out as a lesbian</a>. She has close to two million followers on the popular video sharing app as of October 2021 and also posts her TikToks on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram account</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Rosie O'Donnell Is Close To These 10 Celebs</a></span></p><h2 id=recurring-and-guest-star-roles><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Recurring And Guest Star Roles</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After her second departure from The View, O'Donnell returned to acting full-time, booking various TV roles. She appeared as a guest star on Empire, Mom, and most recently, Run the World on Starz. In addition, she portrayed lesbian activist Del Martin (who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created the first U.S. lesbian civil rights organization</a>) on the ABC miniseries When We Rise. She became a recurring character as a social worker on Freeform's The Fosters and as the fiancé of character Tina Kennard (played by Laurel Holloman) on Showtime's The L Word: Generation Q, which recently finished airing its second season.</p><h2 id=starring-roles><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Starring Roles</span></h2><p>Besides recurring and guest spots, O'Donnell also earned some main roles. In 2017, O'Donnell received positive reviews for her role as Tutu, the mother of main character Bridgette (Frankie Shaw) on Showtime's Smilf. The show lasted two seasons until its 2019 cancellation due to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">misconduct allegations against Shaw</a>. Afterwards, she played a social worker in the HBO miniseries I Know This Much Is True. Back in June, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> she'd play a detective in a reboot of American Gigolo, set to premiere on Showtime next year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=strong-lgbtq-rights-advocate><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Strong LGBTQ+ Rights Advocate</span></h2><p>Since coming out as a lesbian in 2002, O'Donnell has been a vocal proponent of LGBTQ+ rights, particuarly same-sex marriage and adoption, the latter being one of the reasons she decided to come out. A few years later, she became a partner in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">R Family Vacations</a>, a cruise line for same-sex couples and their families. Now in the digital age, she continues to use her celebrity platform through social media to speak out and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">participate in events</a> to raise awareness for LGBTQ+ issues.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>How Rosie O'Donnell Is Adding To Her $120 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2Bwv8ieZKicn6O7prjLZp%2Baq12Xsqa6jK6nZqyfYsCqusKeZKWdkau2r7OMrZ%2BeZaaesrh7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-rosie-odonnell-has-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-view.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-rosie-odonnell-has-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-view.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-rosie-odonnell-has-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-view.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-rosie-odonnell-has-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-view.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-rosie-odonnell-has-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-view.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-rosie-odonnell-has-been-up-to-since-leaving-the-view.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./20-movie-scenes-actors-should-not-have-been-allowed-to-do.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./20-movie-scenes-actors-should-not-have-been-allowed-to-do.html>20 Movie Scenes Actors Should Not Have Been Allowed To Do</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./michael-allio-and-amanda-kloots-relationship.html>The Truth Behind Michael Allio And Amanda Kloots Relationship</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./michael-allio-and-amanda-kloots-relationship.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
