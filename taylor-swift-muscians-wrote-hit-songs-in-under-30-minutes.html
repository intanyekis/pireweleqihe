However, there have been rare instances of artists producing hit songs for the <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a> industry in a matter of minutes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just consider how much you could accomplish in 30 minutes, from getting a manicure to reading a book to working out your entire body. Nowhere on our to-do lists did we find "write a hit song for a massive fan base," but then again, we're no <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>.</strong></p><p>Swift has stated that the legendary We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together was written in under 25 minutes. The following eight tracks were completed in less time than it would take to have takeout brought to your door.</p><p><strong>This list is just a small sample of artists who have been able to write hit songs in 30 minutes or less. Other artists with this amazing talent include: Guns 'N Roses with 'Sweet Child O' Mine,' Eminem with 'Rap God,' Meghan Trainor with "Lips Are Movin," Charlie Puth with "See You Again," Lizzo with "Cuz I Love You," Sia with "Chandelier," and of course, Mariah Carey with "All I Want for Christmas."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>As more artists become inspired and write their songs in 30 minutes or less, the list will be updated.

We worked on that and on two other songs on the EP in a week, and just did a little bit every day."</p><p>They had no idea that their affirmation that, "Yeah, this is cool" would be the century's greatest understatement.
