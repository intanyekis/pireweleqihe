If you have to stand or walk for long periods, for instance, the extra cushioning and structural support provided by a sneaker or clog is a must. In contrast, a business professional setting may require a dressy heel. A chunky loafer or slip-on mule would work well in a business casual environment, as would an ankle boot in the fall.</p><p>No matter your work setting, there are a couple rules that apply to every job: Opt for a shoe that is comfortable and fits you well. A patent leather pump might look gorgeous with crisp office slacks and a flowy blouse, but it can cause serious issues down the road. (Think knee, ankle, hip and lower back pain, ingrown toenails, bunions… you get the picture.) And if something feels a little tight, don’t grin and bear it — it won’t get better. To help you avoid these common problems and others, check out the most important factors to consider before buying the best work shoes for women below.</p><h2 class=section-title>What to Consider When Choosing the Best Work Shoes for Women</h2><h3>Insoles</h3><p>A good insole can make or break a shoe, and if you don’t have to spend money on separate insoles, you’ll save money down the road. We recommend looking for shoes with insoles which have shock absorption materials such as gel or foam. Contoured inserts will also help keep your weight evenly distributed so you don’t develop pain in a particular area of your foot, such as your ankle, heel or forefoot. And if your shoes have washable inserts, consider that an added bonus.</p><h3>Sole</h3><p>Oftentimes, the quality of the sole is the difference between an expensive and budget-friendly shoe. A high-quality sole should have a midsole (the inner part of the sole) with cushioning and structure, and an outsole with plenty of traction. We recommend looking for shoes that have outsoles made of polyurethane or rubber, both of which are lightweight and durable.</p><h3>Support</h3><p>If you have a high step count, you’ll benefit from a work shoe that offers plenty of structure. This means the sole has at least two layers — an outsole and a midsole — and the arches are well supported. Look for shoes that keep your foot in one position as opposed to letting it slide around, and make sure your toes don’t slide into the front with every step, which will place them in an uncomfortable position. Supportive shoes we recommend include clogs, Chelsea boots and sneakers.</p><h3>Style</h3><p>The style of your work shoes is particularly important if you work in an office setting. In this instance, we recommend classic styles such as mules, ballet flats, Mary Janes and similar low heels with pointed or rounded toes. If you want to keep things modern, you can opt for a classic style with a twist, such as a loafer with a chunky sole or a platform boot.</p><h3>Price</h3><p>Your budget will dictate the types of work shoes you select, but it doesn’t have to limit you as greatly as you might think. Generally, we think you won’t have to spend above $250 for a pair of high-quality, comfortable shoes, though you will likely have to spend above $40. The sweet spot for a long-lasting shoe is usually between $100 and $150.</p><h2 class=section-title>What Are the Different Types of Work Shoes for Women?</h2><p>Work shoes for women fall into one of three categories: casual, business casual and business professional.</p><h3>Casual</h3><p>Casual shoes in a work setting aren’t necessarily “cheap.” In reality, these shoes are often the most comfortable and supportive, and therefore they can get expensive quickly. The casual work shoes we recommend include sneakers (or running shoes) and clogs. Running shoes work particularly well for jobs that keep you on your feet for hours because they’re extremely well cushioned.</p><h3>Business Casual</h3><p>Business casual is the broadest category of work shoes and it includes a variety of styles, such as mules, rounded ballet shoes, pointed flats, slip ons and sandals. Mules and other flats don’t offer much support, but they can offer great traction and much greater comfort than heels. If you’re in a business casual setting and want to wear heels, we recommend opting for chunky heels which will provide more support.</p><h3>Business Professional</h3><p>The business professional setting calls for the most formal styles of work shoes. Generally, this means a closed-toe shoe (rounded, pointed and squared all work) and some kind of heel. However, you’ll often find that certain business casual styles also work as business professional styles — such as mules and chunky loafers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6eyt7XEsKpompWowW7DzquiZquYpLK0edaopJ6mXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-work-shoes-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbest-work-shoes-women.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbest-work-shoes-women.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbest-work-shoes-women.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-work-shoes-women.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-work-shoes-women.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-ella-ross-scott-disick-new-model-date.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-ella-ross-scott-disick-new-model-date.html>Ella Ross: 5 Things To Know About Scott Disicks Possible New Fling</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./victoria-monet-quitting-music-bisexuality-1234847270.html>Victoria Mont Says She Nearly Quit Music, Talks Bisexuality</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./victoria-monet-quitting-music-bisexuality-1234847270.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
