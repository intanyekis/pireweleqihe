He earned the role of Dan Humphrey in Gossip Girl, in which he appeared in all six seasons. Gossip Girl's audience was never that big, but it had a huge cultural impact. Dan Humphrey was not one of the rich kids, at least until his dad got remarried. His character was portrayed well and very popular with fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=music-career><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Music Career</span></h2><p>Aside from acting, Badgley has also earned his money through a music career. When Gossip Girl ended in 2012, he switched gears and turned to music. The actor joined friends Jimmy Giannopoulos, Simon Oscroft, and Darren Will and they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">formed the band, MOTHXR</a>. It started out as a passion project, but people soon took an interest in it. The band was signed with Washington Square in 2015 and then toured around the world. Between touring and releasing music, Badgley earned a good amount of money from this aspect of his career.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>20 Facts About Penn Badgley That Fans Of YOU Tend To Ignore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-time-on-39-you-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>His Time On 'You'</span></h2><p>You has captured audiences' attention around the world. Since Badgley is the lead character of the show, he most likely earns the most money amongst the cast, although it is not clear on how much. If the show does good this season, it could earn him a pretty penny. Season 4 will premiere next year and also add to his net worth. You is a psychological thriller series which follows Joe Goldberg who has a dark past and is a straight up serial killer.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Penn Badgley And 14 Other Celebs Expecting A Baby In 2020</a></span></p><h2 id=his-current-net-worth><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>His Current Net Worth</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Currently, <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> puts his net worth at $8 million</a> for 2021.
