In our recent past, power was consolidated amongst a very small group of people, sometimes single individuals such as monarchs and dictators. Of course, this is still the case in various parts of the world, but for the most part we’ve moved past it. The real power is held - for the most part - by governments and corporations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Governments have legal and political control over their respective populations, which is the most direct kind of control. On the other hand, the kind of power that corporations wield is a little bit trickier to pin down and accurately identify. They influence governments through lobbying and influence the public through mass advertising and other mechanisms. Most people looking to make any meaningful change in the world will use either government or the corporate world as their avenue - but there is another way.</p><p>Non-profit organizations have a somewhat deceiving title. Organizations designated as non-profit (NPO’s) receive various tax benefits from their respective domestic governments, as by definition they are required to immediately reinvest any potential profits into the organization’s designated activities. However, it’s important to make the distinction between ‘non-profit’ and ‘poor’. Despite not holding onto and distributing any profits from organizational activities, NPO’s can still be absurdly rich. High ranking members in these organizations can still take home very nice salaries and the bank accounts for these NPO’s can easily be in the 7 figures. Some of these names you’ve probably never encountered before while others you’re probably very familiar with, but the one thing they all have in common is a seriously stacked company account. These are the richest non-profit organizations on the planet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-smithsonian-institute---annual-budget-1-240-978-409><strong>#10 Smithsonian Institute - Annual Budget: $1,240,978,409</strong></h2><p>Via wikimedia.org</p><p>The name of the Smithsonian Institute is most likely at least somewhat familiar to anyone who grew up in the United States or happened to watch any of <a title="Nicolas Cage Net Worth" href=#>Nicolas Cage</a>’s <i>National Treasure</i> movies (hopefully you didn’t have to endure the latter). At its core, the Smithsonian is an organization tasked with the preservation and spread of knowledge to the general public - all at no cost.

The increasing prevalence of autism decade after decade has made Easter Seals double down on their efforts at providing therapy and services to individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.

The organization boasts worldwide membership of almost 1.5 million people and a presence in over 126 nations all over the world.
