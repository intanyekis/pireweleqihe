However, in the case of Major League Baseball, one group of fans has actually gained a reputation for being the “Best Fans in Baseball”. These are the fans of the St. Louis Cardinals. This is a pretty big claim and one that gets questioned constantly from fans of every other team in the league. So is there proof to this claim?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There is a way to judge how loyal a fan base is to their particular team. In order to see how loyal a fan base is, one needs to look no further than how many people are in the seats during their home games. Obviously, if a fan base is ultra-loyal to their team they will go to the home games in hordes.</p><p>In order to figure out how loyal a fan base is, you first must take the average attendance per game for each team. For the purpose of this article, we used the average game attendances for the 2013 season. Since 2014 is still in its earliest stages, it is unfair to take such a small sample. After all, the true fans will go to games in the hottest months and even when their team’s playoff hopes are starting to fade. After figuring average attendances, one must find out the maximum capacity of each stadium.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once these two numbers are discovered, divide the average game attendance by the maximum seating capacity of the stadium. This will show on average the percentage of the seats that were filled each game. When this percentage is high, one can deduce the team has a very loyal fan base. If it is not too high, that team needs to work harder on getting some butts in the seats at their home games.</p><p>While this may not be the best way to judge how passionate a fan base is for their particular team, it is definitely the only objective way. Numbers do not lie. If fans want to show how much they love their favorite team, they do so by going to the games. So, if you do not like that your favorite team is not on the list or not number one; get your friends together and take a trip to the ball park this season.</p><h2 id=10-chicago-cubs><b>10.
