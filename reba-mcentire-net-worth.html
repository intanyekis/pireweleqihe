Over the years, her music gained critical acclaim, which led to the production of a TV series titled Reba. The show gave fans even more of their favorite singer, but it turns out she probably didn't need the cash from the project.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, Reba has generated a massive net worth that outshines many of her contemporaries and today's modern artists. Despite two expensive divorces and some financial setbacks, McEntire's earning power hasn't slipped. Here's everything to know about Reba's rightfully-earned wealth, and how she stacks up against other singers.</p><h2 id=reba-39-s-career-started-in-1975-and-earned-her-millions>Reba's Career Started In 1975 (And Earned Her Millions)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar50238325.jpg><p>Reba may have started out in country music, but she didn't stop there. Over the years, Reba has appeared in various films and TV series, from voicing a character in Charlotte's Web to appearing as a coach on The Voice and even as a guest judge on American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her stint as herself on Reba lasted six years, though the show was ultimately canceled for an interesting reason. It turned out Reba made plenty of money for The CW, but a merger meant that the branding needed to change—and <a href=#>Reba had to be axed</a> so its reruns would stop showing up newer shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>From Shameless To Sweet Magnolias: Where Are The Stars Of Reba Now?</a></span></p><p>The cancelation didn't spell doom for the singer herself, fortunately. Reba McEntire's net worth is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accordingly high at $95 million</a>, thanks to a variety of earning avenues, including music and acting gigs.</p><p>Plus, <a href=#>Reba and her former on-screen nemesis Melissa Peterman</a> kept in touch (they even have a podcast together). For a time, <a href=#>Reba was open to a possible reboot</a> but has since said she doesn't expect that will happen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-does-reba-get-paid-per-concert>How Much Does Reba Get Paid Per Concert?</h2><p>Although it's possible her music made most of those millions, Reba wasn't content to sit back and let her songs bring in revenue. She has headlined tons of concerts over the years, at least 18 through 2023. After everything from a 1989 World Tour to a Starting Over Tour to a 20th Anniversary Tour, Reba has done it all.</p><p>Back in the day, she toured with such 1990s stars as Brooks & Dunn and Martina McBride, later partnering with Kelly Clarkson, Brad Paisley, and George Strait in other tours and even residency shows.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Reba McEntire's Biggest Acting Career Regret Is Turning Down A Film That Made $2.2 Billion At The Box Office</a></span></p><p>Even if she tours simply because she loves her fans, Reba may also be in it for the money. Even in 2013, Reba was (still?) earning hundreds of thousands of dollars for appearances at various venues. For example, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she earned $300,000 for performing</a> as part of a multi-author lineup at the New York State Fair in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That same year, Toby Keith made $425K while Luke Bryan made $470K—with Reba's salary jumping ahead of Fall Out Boy's ($200K), and Lynyrd Skynyrd and Korn ($160K each).</p><p>In terms of attendance, Reba's set was even said to have attracted 6,000 concertgoers, fewer than Toby Keith (10K) and Luke Bryan (17,000) but far more than the other headlining acts.</p><p>Determining how much Reba gets paid per show today may be more difficult, as figures are not readily available, but it would make sense if her solo tours earned her many millions as the headlining attraction. After all, <a href=#>Reba once turned down a $2 billion film</a> because she was busy on tour.</p><h3 id=reba-mcentire-39-s-net-worth-is-higher-than-other-singers-of-her-era>Reba McEntire's Net Worth Is Higher Than Other Singers Of Her Era</h3><p>It only makes sense that Reba's fellow country stars whose concert fees are higher also have higher net worths than her.</p><p>For comparison, Toby Keith is worth about $365 million (per Celebrity Net Worth), but Reba surpasses the net worths of Martina McBride, Pam Tillis, Vince Gill, Terri Clark, and Miranda Lambert, and nearly matches Brooks & Dunn's combined net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Reba also has a higher net worth than contemporary stars like Walker Hayes, Jason Aldean, Luke Combs, and more.</p><h2 id=how-much-does-reba-mcentire-make-per-year>How Much Does Reba McEntire Make Per Year?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/your-paragraph-text-9.png><p>Like any artist, Reba McEntire's yearly salary varies depending on what projects she's working on and whether she's releasing new music, touring, or performing at concerts. However, some sources suggest <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she makes about $8 million per year</a>.</p><p>She may also be worth a bit more than $95 million; some sources state McEntire's net worth at a flat $100M. Either way, she's apparently pulling in more than half a million dollars per month, and has cash to spend.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Steve Howey Really Felt About Working With Reba McEntire On The Sitcom, Reba</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to her earnings from TV, movie, and music work, Reba may also have some extra cash thanks to smart real estate sales. When she and her second husband (Kelly Clarkson's former father-in-law) divorced, they sold a home for $22.5 million—after paying $9 million for it about 12 years earlier. The former couple also owned a home that later sold for $5M.</p><p>In the divorce, it sounds as if <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reba lost many millions to her ex</a>; similar to the way her former stepson's divorce played out with Kelly Clarkson, Reba's ex-husband apparently received a settlement valued at $47.5 million post-split.</p><p>That was back in 2015, however, and Reba's net worth has only risen since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpqRYrqksc2toKudXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2freba-mcentire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2freba-mcentire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2freba-mcentire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2freba-mcentire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2freba-mcentire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2freba-mcentire-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./wild-bill-guerin-investigation-nhl.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./wild-bill-guerin-investigation-nhl.html>Wild GM Bill Guerin investigated for alleged verbal abuse: Sources</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mackzjones.html>Mackenzie Jones (Mackzjones) ike oihana, makahiki, klana pili, ike kino a me ka bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mackzjones.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
