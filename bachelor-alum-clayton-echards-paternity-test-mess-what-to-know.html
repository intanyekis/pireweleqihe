My confusion has been cleared up. I will take my portion of the test on the 27th of September.”</p><p>“[Redacted] will take her portion on the 2nd of October,” he wrote. “Results will then take about a week to get back. I believe we’re all on the same page now.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clayton Echard’s time on “The Bachelor” was dramatic, he chose Susie Evans after sending her home. <span class=credit>ABC via Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Clayton Echard is no longer dating Susie Evans, who he chose at the end of his time on “The Bachelor.” <span class=credit>ABC via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Echard’s time on “The Bachelor” was controversial. He <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately chose Susie Evans</a>, but before that, he sent her home and was intimate with other women.&nbsp;</p><p>In the dramatic finale, Echard decided not to give the final rose to either of&nbsp; the remaining two women – Gabby Windey and Rachel Recchia – and pursued Evans.&nbsp;</p><p>Echard and Evans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced their breakup</a> in September 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>In another slide <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">on his Instagram Story </a>on Thursday, Echard claimed, “I’ve been notified (and have confirmed) that there are other individuals out there with nearly identical accusations being made against them by the exact same person. Some of the court cases are still publicly accessible and active.”</p><p>The unnamed woman and Echard are both due in court for an early resolution conference on Sept. 28.</p><p>On Oct. 6, Echard announced that he is in the clear. “Listen, it’s Friday and you know what we need on a Friday? We need some good news and who has got the good news today? I got the good news today,” Echard, 30, said&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">via an Instagram video</a>&nbsp;on Friday, October 6. “The test results came back early and they said little to no fetal DNA present. Let’s go baby! I knew that was going to happen and thankfully five months of torture can finally be put to rest.”</p><p>He continued: “Two false accusations in two years — I really don’t want to look ahead to next year to see what will happen. I think two false accusations in a lifetime is enough. Thank you all for the support and love. This has been a trying time but I learned so much about myself and now back to the regularly scheduled program.”</p><p>In addition to the paternity mess, Echard is referring to rumors that he in 2022 he cheated on then-girlfriend&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Susie Evans</strong></a>&nbsp;in 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma2pfl66ktMSlpqtlkaHCrnnCpZiyrJ%2Bjeqavx5qpnatdpa61sdGnoK2xXamytMCMppysq12staLAjK2mZqOepMRw</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbachelor-alum-clayton-echards-paternity-test-mess-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbachelor-alum-clayton-echards-paternity-test-mess-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbachelor-alum-clayton-echards-paternity-test-mess-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbachelor-alum-clayton-echards-paternity-test-mess-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbachelor-alum-clayton-echards-paternity-test-mess-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbachelor-alum-clayton-echards-paternity-test-mess-what-to-know.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ariel-winters-t-shirt-trolls-her-haters-do-my-nipples-offend-you.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ariel-winters-t-shirt-trolls-her-haters-do-my-nipples-offend-you.html>Ariel Winters T-Shirt Trolls Her Haters: Do My Nipples Offend You?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-george-alagiah-wife-frances-robathan-wikipedia-age-net-worth-and-children.html>Who Is George Alagiah Wife Frances Robathan?
