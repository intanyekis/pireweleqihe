<time>08 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><h2><span id=Jules_Bianchi-_Biography>Jules Bianchi- Biography</span></h2><p><strong>Jules Bianchi</strong> was a Formula One driver from France. He raced for Marussia F1 Team, Ferrari Driver Academy, and Sahara Force India during his brief career. Bianchi, a native of Nice, was motivated by his grandpa, who participated in GT racing in the 1960s as well as three non-championship Formula One Grands Prix in 1961. Bianchi began kart racing at the age of three. Nicolas Todt took over as his manager when he was 17 years old. In 2007, he raced for the first time in French Formula Renault 2.0, representing SG Formula. Bianchi began his F1 career as a test driver for Sahara Force India in 2012.</p><p>A year later, he made his Formula One debut with Marussia in Australia, finishing 15th in his first race. He did not score any points by the end of the season, finishing in 19th place. Despite this, Marussia kept him for the next season. At the 2014 Monaco Grand Prix, he scored both his own and his team’s first points in F1. Bianchi was engaged in an accident during the Japanese Grand Prix in October 2014 and suffered diffuse axonal damage. Despite being immediately operated on and placed in an induced coma, he died in July 2015.</p><h2><span id=Jules_Bianchi-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Jules Bianchi- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Jules Bianchi was born on August 3, 1989, in Nice, France, as one of three children of Philippe and Christine Bianchi. He had two siblings: a brother named Tom and a sister named Mélanie. Bianchi has been fascinated with racing since he was a child. His grandfather, Mauro Bianchi, competed in GT racing in the 1960s as well as three non-championship F1 Grands Prix in 1961, while his grandfather’s grandfather, Lucien, competed in 19 F1 Grands Prix (1959-1968). He triumphed in the 1968 24 Hours of Le Mans. Michael Schumacher, the legendary driver, was also an inspiration to young Bianchi.</p><p>He began kart racing when he was three years old. This was his first foray into motorsport. Because his father owned a kart track, he had plenty of opportunities to practice driving. Nicolas Todt became his manager when he was 17 years old.</p><h2><span id=Jules_Bianchi-_Relationship_Girlfriend>Jules Bianchi- Relationship, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Bianchi and his girlfriend, Camille Marchetti, a Frenchwoman, had been together for a long time. According to later stories, he had a German girlfriend named Gina who had relocated to Nice.</p><h2><span id=Jules_Bianchi-_Professional_Career>Jules Bianchi- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Jules Bianchi left karting in 2007 to race for the SG Formula in French Formula Renault 2.0. During his time there, he was extremely successful, winning five races and becoming a champion. He also competed in the Formula Renault Eurocup, where he earned one pole position.&nbsp;Bianchi also had one of the quickest laps in each of the three races. He began racing for ART Grand Prix in the Formula 3 Euro Series in late 2007. In 2008, he won the Masters of Formula 3 at Zolder, finishing the season in third place. Bianchi won the title with nine victories in 2009.</p><p>In July 2010, during the main series of the GP2 season in Hungary, he was involved in one of his first accidents. While physicians gave him a dismal diagnosis during the initial assessment of his injury, he eventually recovered completely and competed in the next round of the competition. In 2011, he raced with Esteban Gutiérrez, the 2010 GP3 Series champion, and had a relatively good season. Bianchi won his first GP2 race in the Asia series opening in Abu Dhabi. It was his first win since 2009. He eventually finished third in the main season.<br>Bianchi left F2 in 2012 to compete in the Formula Renault 3.5 Series. He has previously competed in the competition in 2009. Bianchi joined the Tech 1 Racing squad and began racing alongside Kevin Korjus. Korjus was then replaced as his partner by Daniel Abt. In the final round of the title race, he finished second to Robin Frijns.</p><h3><span id=Racing_in_Formula_One>Racing in Formula One</span></h3><p>The BBC and other news sites stated in August 2009 that Bianchi had been chosen for the second Ferrari Formula One seat, which was held by Luca Badoer while Felipe Massa was absent. In December 2009, he was one of the young drivers tested by Ferrari at the Circuito de Jerez and was chosen as the first recruit of the Ferrari Driver Academy. He was Ferrari’s test and reserve driver during the 2011 season. He raced in GP2 at the same time that he worked for Ferrari. Ferrari leased him to Sahara Force India for the 2012 season. Over the course of the year, he acted as a test and reserve driver for the team in nine Friday free practice sessions.</p><p>Marussia announced in March 2013 that Bianchi would replace Luiz Razia as one of their Formula One drivers for the upcoming season. He placed 19th in the Australian Grand Prix qualifying, earning a seat in the finals. He finished 15th in his first race. As of the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2013, he was the top Marussia driver. However, during the Japanese Grand Prix, he and Caterham’s Charles Pic were given a ten-place grid penalty for receiving three reprimands over the season. He was forced to quit the race after colliding with Giedo van der Garde.<br>Marussia stated in October 2013 that they would keep Bianchi for the 2014 season.</p><p>He had considerable difficulties at first, particularly in Australia, where he could not be categorized. After placing tenth at the Monaco Grand Prix, he led his team to their first World Championship points. Bianchi made himself available for the Scuderia Ferrari racing seat a few days before his deadly accident, amid reports that Fernando Alonso was quitting the team.</p><h2><span id=Accidents_and_Death>Accidents and Death</span></h2><p>Despite occasional heavy rain from Typhoon Phanfone and dwindling daylight, the 2014 Japanese Grand Prix took place on October 5 as planned. Bianchi was on his 43rd lap when his car spun out of control and collided with the back of a tractor crane attempting to retrieve Adrian Sutil’s Sauber.</p><p>Sutil had been in an earlier crash and had finished the race in the same spot. The collision between Bianchi’s car and the crane caused the latter to sway and drop the Sauber. The race was eventually called off, and Lewis Hamilton was declared the winner.</p><p>Bianchi was apparently unconscious when he was recovered from the wreckage. He was treated at the crash site before being sent to the circuit’s medical center. Due to the inclement weather, a helicopter could not be hired to transport him to the hospital. As a result, he was transported in an ambulance while being escorted by police.</p><p>Bianchi was promptly operated on, according to sources, to reduce the serious bruises on his skull. The FIA later confirmed that Bianchi had suffered a “serious brain injury” in the incident and would be hospitalized in the Intensive Care Unit after surgery. Following his procedure, Bianchi’s health was serious but stable, and he required a medical ventilator. He was taken out of his induced coma in November 2014 and transferred to the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Nice (CHU) in France. His father confessed in July 2015 that he had grown “less optimistic” because there had been no major change.</p><p>Bianchi died on July 17, 2015, at the age of 25. He was the first Formula One driver to die as a result of racing injuries since Ayrton Senna. His father established a Monaco-based charity in December 2015 to assist future drivers throughout their careers.</p><p>Also Read, <a href=#>Concetta Monti</a>, <a href=#>Chani Natasha</a>, and <a href=#>Peachprc</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Race Car Driver</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Bill Sedgwick</a></h3>Bill Sedgwick estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
