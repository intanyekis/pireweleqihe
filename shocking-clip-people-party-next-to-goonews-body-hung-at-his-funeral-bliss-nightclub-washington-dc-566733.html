However, there was no official confirmation about whether the body was actually his mummified <a href=# rel>corpse</a> or a mannequin. The figure that was seen standing had one hand in his pocket and was dressed in ripped pants, a dark blue Amiri sweater with sneakers and had accessories like a watch and a crown.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who killed Wavy Navy Pooh?

They do stuff like this completely out the box. It’s his wishes not ours. What’s normal isn’t always wanted. We gotta respect that. #Goonew #RIP.” “Aight i let yall get yall jokes off last night but im really curious...are yall clout chasing with these jokes or are yall seriously uncultured?? What they did for Goonew is pretty common ..nd its not the 1st time we seen it on Twitter.” “if y’all didn’t know Goonew, y’all really shouldn’t be speaking on what he wanted or didn’t want.

They took his watch. He gave it up and they still shot him in his back,” his mother added at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRoq5iksKy1zaBknKSZpXqxsc6po55loJa%2FtcWMp5yxrF2pvG6zzqilnq%2BjYq%2BwsNhmn66ml2KutXnHoqpmnqWjsrOty2aZpaGjqHqvtcahq5ykpZd6uK3SoaCnn6Sku26wwmZsb25naIA%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fshocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fshocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fshocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshocking-clip-people-party-next-to-goonews-body-hung-at-his-funeral-bliss-nightclub-washington-dc-566733.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./irene-caras-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-late-american-singer-and-actress.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./irene-caras-net-worth-how-rich-was-the-late-american-singer-and-actress.html>How rich was the late American Singer and Actress?
