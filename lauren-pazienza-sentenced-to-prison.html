I’m just so sorry.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">AJ Maier Gustern aid after court that he felt Pazienza’s apology wasn’t sincere. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><p>Gustern’s grandson, AJ Maier Gustern, said after court that he felt Pazienza’s apology wasn’t sincere — and that she only said it to make herself look good.</p><p>“She’s squirm and squirm and squirm,” Gustern said. “She just doesn’t seem like she is even maybe capable of accepting responsibility.”</p><p>During Pazienza’s speech, a grieving Gustern sat frozen like a statue.</p><p>In his victim impact statement, he cursed Pazienza and said she ruined several pleasures in his life, such as voice lessons from his grandma — and that New York City will never be the same for him.</p><p>“My baba felt safe in this city — even late at night — and you’ve ruined that,” he said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Pazienza only started to cry when she finally said sorry at the end of her speech to the court at her sentencing. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><p>Pazienza was out celebrating her upcoming nuptials with her fiancé at West 28th Street when the pair were tossed out of Chelsea Park because the green space was closing, prosecutors have said.</p><p>The drunk and irate 5-foot-7 Pazienza then had a hissy fit — tossing her food at her beau before defiantly crossing the street.</p><p>That’s when she aggressively shoved Gustern, a 4-foot-11, 100-pound elderly woman. She then callously walked away like nothing happened as the grandma bled from her head, according to the DA’s office.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Surveillance caught Lauren Pazienza leaving the scene of after fatally shoving Barbara Gustern in 2022.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Barbara Gustern worked as a vocal coach. <span class=credit>Tamara Beckwith/NY Post</span></figure><p>Following the attack, Pazienza took the subway back to her Astoria home. She only confessed to her fiancé that she had shoved someone hours later.</p><p>After seeing an article in The Post about Gustern’s death, Pazienza became “really scared and nervous” and attempted to hide by deleting all social media accounts, removing her wedding website, and fleeing to Long Island to stay with her family, prosecutors have said.</p><p>Gustern was a renowned vocal coach whose clients included Blondie’s Debbie Harry.</p><p>Barbara Bleier, a friend and student of Gustern’s, identified herself after the sentencing as the friend that Gustern ran into in her last moments of consciousness after the attack</p><p>“What [Pazienza] said is the usual cop out for an apology. She said ‘I’m sorry it happened.’ It didn’t happen; she happened.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Pazienza’s parents — who were dressed for a funeral — were herded out of the courtroom by Aidala, neither stopping for a moment to take questions.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Jma3Ffoa62vsSnZKmZqp6yr8bAZqqepqSau6Sxw2arqGWgp7a0u81o</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2flauren-pazienza-sentenced-to-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2flauren-pazienza-sentenced-to-prison.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2flauren-pazienza-sentenced-to-prison.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2flauren-pazienza-sentenced-to-prison.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2flauren-pazienza-sentenced-to-prison.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2flauren-pazienza-sentenced-to-prison.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lynne-spears-denies-throwing-out-britney-spears-dolls-happy-to-send.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lynne-spears-denies-throwing-out-britney-spears-dolls-happy-to-send.html>Lynne Spears Denies Throwing Out Britney Spears Dolls: 'Happy to Send'</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./emmanuel-hudson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-492235-html.html>Emmanuel Hudson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./emmanuel-hudson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-492235-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
