In the lawsuit, she claimed the dog managed to leave massive bite marks all over her body, including on her face, arms, and torso. The incident took place in December 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Marry In Lavish July 4th Weekend Wedding Ceremony</a></span></p><p>The dog in question, named Hades, is a Caucasian Shepherd Ovcharka, a large breed that has traditionally been used as a guard dog. The breed originated in the Caucasus region of Europe, hence its name. Known for their large stature, the dogs usually grow to up to be between 40-50kg and 67-75 cm in height.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising part of the lawsuit, however, is the housekeeper’s claims that <a href=#>Chris and his entourage did not try to intervene</a> despite being home at the time. In fact, the former employee, whose name has not been released to the media, said that the musician tried to cover-up the dog attack when authorities eventually arrived on the scene.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The court documents allege that Chris only came to the housekeeper’s aid once the dog had stopped attacking. However, shortly after 911 was called, the singer had his team try to get rid of the evidence. Specifically, the housekeeper says he instructed his team to clean up the bloody mess as well as take the dogs and leave before authorities arrived.</p><p>Even more, the housekeeper is claiming Chris tried to evade the police by providing misleading information about the incident. She alleges he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">police</a> he didn’t know what happened or who had taken the dogs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>TMZ reports that authorities eventually apprehended the canine and put him down after he was deemed to be a danger to society. However, the dog was found in Humboldt County, located in Northern California, which the publication notes is several hours away from the singer’s Tarzana property. It’s unclear why the dog was in Humboldt or how he was found.</p><p>Currently, it’s unclear exactly how much the former employee is seeking in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit</a>. She says she required surgery to treat the injuries she sustained during the attack. Her husband is also reportedly suing Chris for damages, specifically for the “loss of the ability to have the love and companionship of his wife,” TMZ explains. So far, Chris’ team has not commented on the suit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even more, it was reported in April that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the housekeeper’s sister, Patricia Avila, also filed her own lawsuit</a> on behalf of her sister. Court documents from her lawsuit explain that her sister was being paid $600 per day to clean Chris’ L.A. home. They go on to allege the dog had a history of aggression and ended up taking off 3 to 4 inches of the woman's skin during the attack.</p><p>However, it’s currently unclear why Avila filed a lawsuit before her sister since she was not the victim of the attack and it does not appear she was present at the Tarzana property when the incident occurred.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Smith Drops $100K On New Orleans July 4th Fireworks Display</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Beast</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqb7IrGSbqp%2Bsu264wLCqrqGkYrGws4yhpq6rlaCyprzEq2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fchris-brown-lawsuit-dog-housekeeper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fchris-brown-lawsuit-dog-housekeeper.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fchris-brown-lawsuit-dog-housekeeper.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fchris-brown-lawsuit-dog-housekeeper.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fchris-brown-lawsuit-dog-housekeeper.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fchris-brown-lawsuit-dog-housekeeper.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dylan-bauer.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dylan-bauer.html>Dylan Bauer</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./1188-a-pair-the-most-expensive-socks-in-the-world.html>$1,188 A Pair: The Most Expensive Socks In The World</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./1188-a-pair-the-most-expensive-socks-in-the-world.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
