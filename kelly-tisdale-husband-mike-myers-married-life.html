Kelly’s spouse is well-known for his roles as Wayne Campbell in Wayne’s World, the voice of the main character in the Dreamworks animated feature Shrek, and Austin, the parody spy in the action comedy series Austin Powers.</strong></p><h2><span id=Kelly_Tisdale8217s_parents_and_birth_details>Kelly Tisdale’s parents and birth details</span></h2><p>Tisdale, born in March 1977, is the daughter of Jennifer Spielmann and Daniel Tisdale. Jennifer, Kelly’s mother, passed away in 2014.</p><p>Kelly, the spouse of the Pentaverate actor, is a native of Templeton, Massachusetts. Her hometown is a little town situated between Orange and Fitchburg.</p><p>Regarding her schooling, 45-year-old Tisdale is a graduate of Suffolk University, where she majored in government and international relations. Kelly relocated to New York and started working for Human Rights Watch after graduating from college.</p><h2><span id=What_Is_The_Profession_of_Kelly_Tisdale>What Is The Profession of Kelly Tisdale?</span></h2><p>Although she is currently somewhat unknown, she was reportedly a co-founder of Teany, a hipster cafe on New York’s Lower East Side.</p><p>Mike Myers, a 59-year-old actor from the Austin Powers series, and his wife Kelly own a vegan restaurant in Massachusetts.</p><p>Together with her then-boyfriend Moby, she had opened the vegan restaurant. In addition, Tisdale has experience as a scenic artist in the entertainment business while not being an actress. She worked for the 1994 animated series Erotic Confessions in the art department.</p><h2><span id=The_Relationship_Between_Kelly_Tisdale_and_Her_Husband_Mike_Myers>The Relationship Between Kelly Tisdale and Her Husband, Mike Myers</span></h2><p>Shortly after Myers’ first marriage to comedy writer and actress Robin Ruzan ended, Kelly got to know the Toronto-born actor. Myers had been married to Ruzan for twelve years. It seems that Tisdale and the Shrek actor began dating around 2006.</p><p>After that, they would date for four years until getting married in the fall of 2010. When they first started dating, Kelly and Myers didn’t hold back while discussing their relationship with outsiders. Myers was much more well-known than his wife Tisdale, yet it was Myers who initially discussed her relationship with the comedian/actor.</p><p>Kelly revealed in an interview that they had been dating for a few months and that she was shocked no one had discovered their relationship sooner.</p><p>We’re genuinely shocked that you guys weren’t aware of us earlier.</p><p>According to the National Enquirer, the blonde Bostonian stated. The couple’s relationship was first made public when a photo of them having fun on vacation in Hawaii was released to the media.</p><h2><span id=For_some_months_AD_Tisdale_and_Myers_kept_their_marriage_a_secret>For some months, AD Tisdale and Myers kept their marriage a secret.</span></h2><p>2010 saw the union of Myers and Kelly in New York. However, the actor and the resident of Templeton kept their marriage a secret for around half a year.</p><p>The couple’s wedding was kept a secret from everyone until five months after it took place. The first to confirm their nuptials was Page Six.</p><p>According to Myers and Tisdale’s representative, they exchanged vows in front of their immediate family and friends, but the tabloids were unable to obtain any information regarding their nuptials. At that time, the Amsterdam celebrity was in his late 40s, and his spouse was in her early 30s.</p><h2><span id=Three_children_are_the_parents_of_Kelly_Tisdale_and_her_spouse_Myers>Three children are the parents of Kelly Tisdale and her spouse, Myers.</span></h2><p>Kelly gave birth to their first child, a son named Spike Myers, in September 2011, a year after they were married. Three years later, in April 2014, they welcomed their first daughter, Sunday Molly, and in November 2015, they welcomed their youngest, Paulina. Mike, Kelly’s comedian and actor husband, was already 47 years old when he became a father for the first time.</p><p>Kelly and Myers’ son Spike was four years old and their daughter Sunday Molly was eighteen months old when their third child was born.</p><h2><span id=Kelly_the_wife_of_Austin_Powers_actor_Mike_Myers_holding_one_of_her_kids>Kelly, the wife of Austin Powers actor Mike Myers, holding one of her kids.</span></h2><p>The reason the couple called their first kid Spike, according to reports, was that Myers was a fan of the poet and comic Spike Milligan, and they were fascinated by the name’s popularity in Liverpool, England.</p><p>Regarding their daughter’s name, Sunday, Kelly and Mike intended to make the most despised weekday into something positive by associating it with their daughter.</p><p>“I’m not even kidding, my wife Kelly and I detest Sundays, so we wanted to change that and make it a positive thing.”</p><p>remarked the comedian from Canada.</p><p>Sunday’s middle name also originated from Myers’s aunt, who was born and raised in Liverpool, England, and shared the same name. It seems that Tisdale’s actor husband views her as his angel of protection.</p><h2><span id=Tisdale_is_Myers8217s_second_wife>Tisdale is Myers’s second wife.</span></h2><p>As previously noted, Myers was the spouse of comic writer and actress Robin Ruzan before Tisdale, the voice actor, became the proprietor of the cafe. Before getting a divorce in 2005, they were married for 12 years.</p><h2><span id=Kelly8217s_Previous_Partnership_She_Courted_Her_Business_Associate>Kelly’s Previous Partnership: She Courted Her Business Associate</span></h2><p>Kelly Tisdale was the dance music sensation Toby’s girlfriend before she became a cringe-worthy comedy star. As previously indicated, Myers’ current wife opened Teany, her cafe, with him.</p><p>It is said that they dated throughout the 1990s. Toby, Kelly’s ex-husband, was a producer and musician as well.</p><h2><span id=Mike_Myers_Kelly_Tisdale8217s_husband_is_wealthy_what_is_his_net_worth>Mike Myers, Kelly Tisdale’s husband, is wealthy; what is his net worth?</span></h2><p>According to International Business Times, Kelly’s spouse and longterm boyfriend Mike Myers is extremely affluent, having amassed a staggering net worth of over $200 million thus far.</p><p>Apart from earning millions of dollars from successful film franchises such as Austin Powers, Wayne’s World, and Shrek, Tisdale’s actor husband also works as a producer and occasionally releases his films.</p><p>The satirist reportedly made around $30 million portraying Shrek in the first animated Shrek movie and somewhat less than $40 million from his Austin Powers fame, based only on long-term Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Charlie Bigelow</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shura Baryshnikov</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Tara Perry</a>.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity wife</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Is Baron Davis Dating Anyone | Relationship Timeline And Dating History</a></h3>Laura Dern was seen with Baron Davis on several occasions.
