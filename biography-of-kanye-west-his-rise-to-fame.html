Kanye Omari West was born on June 8th, 1977 in Atlanta, Georgia and he is an American rapper/songwriter/producer, film director, fashion designer, restaurant owner, gay rights advocate and an active and well-respected philanthropist. In 1980, he moved with his mother, Dr. Donda West to Chicago, Illinois after the divorce of his parents. His mother was the Chair of the English Department at Chicago State University. She retired later on to become her son s manager. When he was 10 years old, his mother took him to Nanjing, China because she was asked to teach at Nanjing University, as part of an exchange program between the two universities. Kanye picked up Chinese pretty fast and he adjusted to the new environment very well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His father, Ray West is a former member of the African-American revolutionary socialist Black Panther Party (1966-1982), he was involved in the Black Power movement in the 1970s and he was among the first black photojournalists working for "The Atlanta Journal Constitution". Kanye attended Polaris High School in Oak Lawn, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago and he was a very good student, managing to get only A s and B s. In 1997, he received a scholarship and he attended art classes, for one semester, at the Chicago s Academy Of Art, wherefrom he transferred to Chicago State University, only to drop out eventually because he wanted to pursuit a music career.</p><h2 id=kanye-and-his-music-debut><strong>Kanye and his Music Debut&nbsp;</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His music debut took place in 1996, when he produced 8 tracks on the debut album "Down To Earth" of Grav, a Chicago rapper. Kanye became a member and producer of a Chicago rap group called Go-Getters, together with rappers Timmy G, GLC, Arrowstar and Really Doe. The only album of the group, "World Record Holders" was released in 1999. West also produced between 1998 and 1999 for renowned artists suchlike Foxy Brown, Jermaine Dupri and Goodie Mob. Kanye West got his first important break in 2000, working as a producer for various artists signed to Roc-A-Fella Records. He produced Jay Z s "This Can t Be Life" by speeding up the drum beat taken from Dr. Dre s "Xxplosive". His biggest influence in music is Wu-Tang Clan and RZA in particular and his mentor is Dion Wilson or No I.D., the godfather of Chicago rap and vice-president of Def Jam Recordings.</p><h2 id=kanye-and-his-accomplishments><strong>Kanye and his Accomplishments</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He received international recognition for producing<a title="Jay-Z Net Worth" href=#> Jay-Z</a> s sixth studio album and critically acclaimed "The Blueprint" and several hit singles for Janet Jackson, Ludacris and Alicia Keys, with huge commercial success. Initially, his production style combined his own instruments/drums with pitched-up samples taken from various soul tracks. Later, he redefined his style by also incorporating music genres like electronica, trip hop, the 1970 s R&B, classical music, technopop, anthem rock and baroque pop. He soon became a sought-after, cutting-edge and successful producer and during 2002-2003, he produced for artists like Monica, T.I., Nas, Mos Def, DMX, Ludacris and many others.</p><p>With all his success as a producer, he complained to Chris Anokute at Def Jam about the fact that no one in the industry took him seriously as a solo artist and rapper. Iniatially Roc-A-Fella Records refused to sign him, because he was not marketable as a rapper. Nevertheless, his solo career began when he rapped the third verse of Jay Z s "The Bounce" recorded on "The Blueprint" and he was eventually signed to Roc-A-Fella Records. His debut album as a solo artist, "The College Dropout " was released in February 2004 and it was critically acclaimed. It featured his first solo single "Through the Wire", which was inspired from an almost fatal car crash he was involved in, on October 23rd, 2002 as well as "Jesus Walks", pervaded with his strong Christian faith. This first album received a triple platinum certification, it featured Jay-Z, Common, Mos Def, Ludacris and GLC and it encompassed some of his now famous style and artistry aspects - sampling and wordplay. During this time, he also produced Brandy s "Talk About Our Love", Keyshia Cole s "I Changed My Mind" and Twista s "Overnight Celebrity".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His second studio album, "Late Registration", which was released on August 30th, 2005 was more eclectic than the first and it became the best album of the year and a "hip-hop classic" as it was called by "The Rolling Stones" magazine. On this triple platinum album, Kanye worked with movie score composer Jon Brion. This became a commercial success and it grossed over 2,4 million units sold in the US alone. It earned 8 Grammy nominations. In MTV s "All Eyes on Kanye West" in the same year, he addressed homophobia issues in the hip-hop culture by making a comparison between the civil rights of the African-Americans over the course of time and the gay rights in today s society. Kanye also shared his beliefs and experiences with the gay and black communities and stated that his cousin is gay and he would always love him, no matter what. By raising awareness in the black gay community, he also paved the way for better understanding, acknowledgement and acceptance of this community in the hip-hop culture. The controversial and outspoken artist managed to reshape and redefine the mainstream with his first two albums and his "introspective yet glossy rap" distinctive style (Rolling Stone).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye released his third studio album entitled "Graduation" in 2007, on the same day as 50 Cent s album "Curtis", it was certified double platinum and it featured Lil Wayne, Mos Def and T-Pain. On March 25th, 2007 he supported together with his father the World Water Day, by involving themselves in the rally "Walk for Water". Kanye also provided the capital to help his father open the cafe Good Water Store in Lexington, Maryland. On November 2007, his mother unfortunately died of complications following an unsuccessful liposuction and abdominoplasty, at 58 years old. Devastated, Kanye dedicated to his late mother the songs "Hey Mama" and "Don t Stop Believin" performed during his "Glow in the Dark" world tour. In 2008 he spoke publicly for the first about her death, saying that it was like trying to walk with no arm and no leg. Former California governor Schwarzenegger passed the legislation "Donda West Law", which stipulates that it is compulsory for patients looking to undergo plastic surgery to provide a medical clearance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008 he released his forth album "808s & Heartbreak", in 2010 he released his fifth studio album "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy", in 2011 the collaborative studio album "Watch the Throne" together with Jay-Z and in 2012 the compilation album "Good Summer" with GOOD Music (Kanye is the head of this label). He is nowadays considered one of the greatest hip hop artists of all times, because his albums have changed the industry and his unique music is here to stay. His 2008 commercially successful album paved the stylistic way for breakthrough hip-hop artists like Drake, Kid Cudi, Casey Veggies and B.o.B., who admit that West is one of their biggest influence. In terms of personal life, after failed romantic relationships with fashion designer Alexis Phifer and top-model Amber Rose, West has a relationship with Kim Kardashian ever since April 2012 and in December 2012 the couple announced that they are expecting their first baby.

On March 2013, he flew in from Europe, where he is currently on tour, in order to surprise the "Keeeping up with the Kardashians" celebrity at the premiere of her first movie "Temptation: Confessions of a Marriage Counselor" in Atlanta, Georgia. Kim was totally shocked, especially since she has no idea that he was coming and the reunion was exactly what the couple needed, because they had not seen each other for 11 days, ever since she came to visit him in Paris. Kim admitted that her first pregnancy was not very easy and Kanye s precious support, attention and understanding means the world to her, because it helps her cope better with this "painful" and "difficult" time in her life. Kanye is very preoccupied with the health of his five-month pregnant girlfriend and he does not let her do anything that might put her or his unborn child at risk.

The couple s new neighbors include Jennifer Aniston and Joe Francis. "Kimye" have not made any wedding plans yet, because Kim is still married to Kris Humphries, who refuses to settle and whom she fears that he would ruin her pregnancy miracle. Once the divorce is finalized, they will get married because they feel true love for one another. Because Kanye is a true gentleman, he does not want to propose to Kim until she is legally divorced. The happy couple refused a $3 million foreign tabloid's offer for the first pictures of their baby, because the privacy of their future family comes first and money can wait.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kanye West owns a white <a title="Lamborghini Celebrates 50 Years of Great Cars" href=#>Lamborghini </a>Gallardo, worth $200,000, which he used on a sightseeing trip together with Kim to Paris in 2012, a black Lamborghini Aventador, worth a whopping $400,000 received as a gift for his 35th birthday from the reality star vixen, a Mercedes G-500, a Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren and an Aston Martin DB9.
